      It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of
      a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
   
      However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
      first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
      of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
      of some one or other of their daughters.
   
      My dear Mr. Bennet,; said his lady to him one day, ;have you heard that
      Netherfield Park is let at last?;
     
      Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
   
     ;But it is,; returned she; ;for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told
      me all about it.;
    
      Mr. Bennet made no answer.
   
      ;Do you not want to know who has taken it?; cried his wife impatiently.
  
     want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.;
    
      This was invitation enough.
   
     ;Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by
      a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down
      on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted
      with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take
      possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the
      house by the end of next week.;
     
      ;What is his name?;
    
     ;Bingley.;
   
      ;Is he married or single?;
     
      ;Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
      five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!;
   
      ;How so? How can it affect them?;
     
      ;My dear Mr. Bennet,; replied his wife, ;how can you be so tiresome! You
      must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.;
    
     ;Is that his design in settling here?;
     
    ;Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he 
      fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as
      he comes.;
    
     ;I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
      them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as
      handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.;
    
     ;My dear, you flatter me. I certainly  had my share of beauty,
      but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has
      five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
      beauty.;
     
      ;In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.;
    
      ;But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
      the neighbourhood.;

     ;It is more than I engage for, I assure you.;
     
      ;But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be
      for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely
      on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed
      you must go, for it will be impossible for  to visit him if you
      do not.;
  
      ;You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad
      to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty
      consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must
      throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.;
   
      ;I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
      others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
      good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving  the
      preference.;
    
     ;They have none of them much to recommend them,; replied he; ;they are all
      silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
      quickness than her sisters.;
     
      ;Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You
      take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.;
     
     ;You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are
      my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these
      last twenty years at least.;
     
      ;Ah, you do not know what I suffer.;
    
     ;But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
      thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.;
    
    ;It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
      visit them.;
     
     ;Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
      all.;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve,
      and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been
      insufficient to make his wife understand his character. <i>Her</i> mind
      was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
      little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she
      fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters
      married; its solace was visiting and news.
   
 

  
      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
      had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
      wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid
      she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner.
      Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly
      addressed her with:
    
      ;I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.;
     
      ;We are not in a way to know  Mr. Bingley likes,; said her
      mother resentfully, ;since we are not to visit.;
     
   ;But you forget, mamma,; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;that we shall meet him at the
      assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.;
     
      ;I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of
      her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of
      her.;
    
     ;No more have I,; said Mr. Bennet; ;and I am glad to find that you do not
      depend on her serving you.;
    
      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself,
      began scolding one of her daughters.
  
      ;Don&rsquo;t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven;s sake! Have a little
      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.;
    
    ;Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,&rdquo; said her father; ;she times them
      ill.;
   
      ;I do not cough for my own amusement,; replied Kitty fretfully. ;When is
      your next ball to be, Lizzy?
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, so it is,&rdquo; cried her mother, &ldquo;and Mrs. Long does not come back till
      the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she
      will not know him herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
      Mr. Bingley to <i>her</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
      myself; how can you be so teasing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I honour your circumspection. A fortnight&rsquo;s acquaintance is certainly
      very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
      fortnight. But if <i>we</i> do not venture somebody else will; and after
      all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,
      as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
      take it on myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, &ldquo;Nonsense,
      nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Do you
      consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them,
      as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you <i>there</i>. What say you,
      Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great
      books and make extracts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While Mary is adjusting her ideas,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;let us return to Mr.
      Bingley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sick of Mr. Bingley,&rdquo; cried his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to hear <i>that</i>; but why did not you tell me that before?
      If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on
      him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot
      escape the acquaintance now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
      Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
      was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade
      you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an
      acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too,
      that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet; and,
      as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an excellent father you have, girls!&rdquo; said she, when the door was
      shut. &ldquo;I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
      or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant,
      I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your
      sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you <i>are</i> the
      youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Lydia stoutly, &ldquo;I am not afraid; for though I <i>am</i> the
      youngest, I&rsquo;m the tallest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return
      Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.

      Chapter 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
      daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
      husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in
      various ways&mdash;with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
      distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
      last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
      Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
      delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
      with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
      dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes
      of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s heart were entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, &ldquo;and all the others equally well married,
      I shall have nothing to wish for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s visit, and sat about ten
      minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
      admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
      much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate,
      for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he
      wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had
      Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
      housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
      was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to
      accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
      disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so
      soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he
      might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled
      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by
      starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party
      for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring
      twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls
      grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before
      the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him
      from London&mdash;his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party
      entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether&mdash;Mr.
      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
      with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
      looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of
      the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the
      report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his
      entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him
      to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer
      than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about
      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of
      his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his
      company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in
      Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable
      countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people
      in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry
      that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at
      Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a
      contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.
      Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other
      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room,
      speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided.
      He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody
      hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent
      against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was
      sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her
      daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
      down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
      standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
      Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to
      join it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Darcy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing
      about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly
      acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be
      insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in
      the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not be so fastidious as you are,&rdquo; cried Mr. Bingley, &ldquo;for a
      kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
      life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
      uncommonly pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of
      her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare
      say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which do you mean?&rdquo; and turning round he looked for a moment at
      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
      &ldquo;She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt <i>me</i>; I am in no
      humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by
      other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for
      you are wasting your time with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
      remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
      however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
      playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
      Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.
      Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by
      his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be,
      though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane&rsquo;s pleasure. Mary had heard
      herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the
      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to
      be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at
      a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the
      village where they lived, and of which they were the principal
      inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless
      of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to
      the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He
      had rather hoped that his wife&rsquo;s views on the stranger would be
      disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,&rdquo; as she entered the room, &ldquo;we have had a most
      delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane
      was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she
      looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her
      twice! Only think of <i>that</i>, my dear; he actually danced with her
      twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
      time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
      up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
      can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down
      the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her
      for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two
      fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two
      sixth with Lizzy, and the <i>Boulanger</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had had any compassion for <i>me</i>,&rdquo; cried her husband
      impatiently, &ldquo;he would not have danced half so much! For God&rsquo;s sake, say
      no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first
      dance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
      handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
      anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
      Hurst&rsquo;s gown&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
      description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of
      the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
      exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can assure you,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that Lizzy does not lose much by not
      suiting <i>his</i> fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not
      at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
      him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!
      Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to
      have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p>
      When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
      her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very
      much she admired him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is just what a young man ought to be,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;sensible,
      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!&mdash;so much
      ease, with such perfect good breeding!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is also handsome,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, &ldquo;which a young man ought
      likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did
      not expect such a compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not you? <i>I</i> did for you. But that is one great difference between us.
      Compliments always take <i>you</i> by surprise, and <i>me</i> never. What
      could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing
      that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.
      No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable,
      and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lizzy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
      You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in
      your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what
      I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you do; and it is <i>that</i> which makes the wonder. With <i>your</i>
      good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!
      Affectation of candour is common enough&mdash;one meets with it
      everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design&mdash;to take
      the good of everybody&rsquo;s character and make it still better, and say
      nothing of the bad&mdash;belongs to you alone. And so you like this man&rsquo;s
      sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not&mdash;at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
      converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his
      house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
      neighbour in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
      the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
      quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
      with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very
      little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not
      deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
      making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited.
      They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private
      seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the
      habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of
      rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
      themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the
      north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories
      than that their brother&rsquo;s fortune and their own had been acquired by
      trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand
      pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did
      not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made
      choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the
      liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the
      easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his
      days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though
      he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means
      unwilling to preside at his table&mdash;nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
      married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his
      house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two
      years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at
      Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour&mdash;was
      pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what
      the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
      great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
      easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
      could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
      never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy&rsquo;s regard, Bingley
      had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In
      understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient,
      but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
      fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that
      respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being
      liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
      characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
      prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to
      him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt
      acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
      conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
      collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
      none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
      either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
      but she smiled too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so&mdash;but still they admired
      her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
      they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
      established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
      commendation to think of her as he chose.

      Chapter 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were
      particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in
      Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of
      knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction
      had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his
      business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting
      them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from
      Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think
      with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy
      himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his
      rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all
      attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his
      presentation at St. James&rsquo;s had made him courteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable
      neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of them, a
      sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      intimate friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball
      was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the
      former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> began the evening well, Charlotte,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet with
      civil self-command to Miss Lucas. &ldquo;<i>You</i> were Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s first
      choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
      sure that <i>did</i> seem as if he admired her&mdash;indeed I rather
      believe he <i>did</i>&mdash;I heard something about it&mdash;but I hardly
      know what&mdash;something about Mr. Robinson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I
      mention it to you? Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s asking him how he liked our Meryton
      assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
      women in the room, and <i>which</i> he thought the prettiest? and his
      answering immediately to the last question: &lsquo;Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,
      beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed&mdash;that does seem as
      if&mdash;but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>My</i> overhearings were more to the purpose than <i>yours</i>,
      Eliza,&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as
      his friend, is he?&mdash;poor Eliza!&mdash;to be only just <i>tolerable</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you would not put it into Lizzy&rsquo;s head to be vexed by his
      ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a
      misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat
      close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure, ma&rsquo;am?&mdash;is not there a little mistake?&rdquo; said
      Jane. &ldquo;I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye&mdash;because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
      could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being
      spoke to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Bingley told me,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;that he never speaks much, unless
      among his intimate acquaintances. With <i>them</i> he is remarkably
      agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable,
      he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody
      says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow
      that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a
      hack chaise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,&rdquo; said Miss Lucas, &ldquo;but I wish
      he had danced with Eliza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another time, Lizzy,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;I would not dance with <i>him</i>,
      if I were you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, ma&rsquo;am, I may safely promise you <i>never</i> to dance with
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His pride,&rdquo; said Miss Lucas, &ldquo;does not offend <i>me</i> so much as pride
      often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
      very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
      should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a <i>right</i>
      to be proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, &ldquo;and I could easily forgive <i>his</i>
      pride, if he had not mortified <i>mine</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pride,&rdquo; observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
      reflections, &ldquo;is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever
      read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is
      particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not
      cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or
      other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though
      the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being
      vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we
      would have others think of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,&rdquo; cried a young Lucas, who came with his
      sisters, &ldquo;I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
      foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet;
      &ldquo;and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
      would, and the argument ended only with the visit.

      Chapter 6
    </h2>
    <p>
      The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was
      soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet&rsquo;s pleasing manners grew on the
      goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found
      to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish
      of being better acquainted with <i>them</i> was expressed towards the two
      eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure,
      but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,
      hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their
      kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all
      probability from the influence of their brother&rsquo;s admiration. It was
      generally evident whenever they met, that he <i>did</i> admire her and to
      <i>her</i> it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
      which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way
      to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not
      likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with
      great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform
      cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the
      impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may perhaps be pleasant,&rdquo; replied Charlotte, &ldquo;to be able to impose on
      the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so
      very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from
      the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will
      then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.
      There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that
      it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all <i>begin</i> freely&mdash;a
      slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have
      heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out
      of ten a woman had better show <i>more</i> affection than she feels.
      Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like
      her, if she does not help him on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If
      <i>I</i> can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed,
      not to discover it too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane&rsquo;s disposition as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it,
      he must find it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane
      meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they
      always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every
      moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore
      make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention.
      When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love
      as much as she chooses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your plan is a good one,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, &ldquo;where nothing is in
      question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to
      get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
      these are not Jane&rsquo;s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she
      cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
      reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances
      with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has
      since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to
      make her understand his character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as you represent it. Had she merely <i>dined</i> with him, she might
      only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember
      that four evenings have also been spent together&mdash;and four evenings
      may do a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
      like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading
      characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Charlotte, &ldquo;I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she
      were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of
      happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.
      Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions
      of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar
      beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always
      continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of
      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of
      the person with whom you are to pass your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
      sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
      was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
      interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
      allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
      ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
      sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had
      a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
      this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
      detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in
      her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
      pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of
      the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this
      she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself
      agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
      with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
      drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas&rsquo;s, where a large party were
      assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does Mr. Darcy mean,&rdquo; said she to Charlotte, &ldquo;by listening to my
      conversation with Colonel Forster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what
      he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being
      impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
      any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a
      subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned
      to him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
      just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
      Meryton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
      energetic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are severe on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be <i>her</i> turn soon to be teased,&rdquo; said Miss Lucas. &ldquo;I am
      going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!&mdash;always wanting
      me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a
      musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really
      rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the
      very best performers.&rdquo; On Miss Lucas&rsquo;s persevering, however, she added,
      &ldquo;Very well, if it must be so, it must.&rdquo; And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy,
      &ldquo;There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar
      with: &lsquo;Keep your breath to cool your porridge&rsquo;; and I shall keep mine to
      swell my song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or
      two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
      would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
      sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the
      family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
      impatient for display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
      application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
      manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
      had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
      much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end
      of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch
      and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of
      the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one
      end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing
      the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much
      engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his
      neighbour, till Sir William thus began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is
      nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first
      refinements of polished society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
      the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir William only smiled. &ldquo;Your friend performs delightfully,&rdquo; he continued
      after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; &ldquo;and I doubt not that you
      are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
      you often dance at St. James&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a house in town, I conclude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Darcy bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself&mdash;for I am fond
      of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
      London would agree with Lady Lucas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
      make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck
      with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow me
      to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot
      refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.&rdquo; And, taking
      her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely
      surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back,
      and said with some discomposure to Sir William:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not
      to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her
      hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all
      shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
      the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
      amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
      for one half-hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Darcy is all politeness,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
      cannot wonder at his complaisance&mdash;for who would object to such a
      partner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured
      her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency,
      when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can guess the subject of your reverie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should imagine not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
      in this manner&mdash;in such society; and indeed I am quite of your
      opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise&mdash;the
      nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I
      give to hear your strictures on them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
      agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which
      a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would
      tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy
      replied with great intrepidity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Elizabeth Bennet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Elizabeth Bennet!&rdquo; repeated Miss Bingley. &ldquo;I am all astonishment.
      How long has she been such a favourite?&mdash;and pray, when am I to wish
      you joy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady&rsquo;s
      imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to
      matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is
      absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;
      and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain
      herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was
      safe, her wit flowed long.

      Chapter 7
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
      thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in
      default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother&rsquo;s fortune,
      though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the
      deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had
      left her four thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their
      father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London
      in a respectable line of trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient
      distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or
      four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner&rsquo;s
      shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and
      Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were
      more vacant than their sisters&rsquo;, and when nothing better offered, a walk
      to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish
      conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in
      general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At
      present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by
      the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to
      remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting
      intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the
      officers&rsquo; names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,
      and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips
      visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity
      unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s
      large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was
      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.
    </p>
    <p>
      After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet
      coolly observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of
      the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am
      now convinced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
      indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
      her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next
      morning to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am astonished, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, &ldquo;that you should be so ready
      to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of
      anybody&rsquo;s children, it should not be of my own, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had
      hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far
      differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
      foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
      their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
      not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I
      liked a red coat myself very well&mdash;and, indeed, so I do still at my
      heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
      should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
      Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William&rsquo;s in
      his regimentals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; cried Lydia, &ldquo;my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
      Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson&rsquo;s as they did when they first
      came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke&rsquo;s library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
      note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for
      an answer. Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly
      calling out, while her daughter read,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
      Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is from Miss Bingley,&rdquo; said Jane, and then read it aloud.
    </p>
    <p class="letter">
      &ldquo;MY DEAR FRIEND,&mdash;<br />
      &ldquo;If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we
      shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a
      whole day&rsquo;s <i>tête-à-tête</i> between two women can never end without a quarrel.
      Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen
      are to dine with the officers.&mdash;Yours ever,
    </p>
    <p class="right">
      &ldquo;CAROLINE BINGLEY&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the officers!&rdquo; cried Lydia. &ldquo;I wonder my aunt did not tell us of <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dining out,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, &ldquo;that is very unlucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I have the carriage?&rdquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
      rain; and then you must stay all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a good scheme,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;if you were sure that they
      would not offer to send her home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s chaise to go to Meryton,
      and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had much rather go in the coach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
      wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you have got them to-day,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;my mother&rsquo;s purpose
      will be answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
      were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
      mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
      day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained
      hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The
      rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly
      could not come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet more than once,
      as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next
      morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
      contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
      brought the following note for Elizabeth:
    </p>
    <p class="letter">
      &ldquo;MY DEAREST LIZZY,&mdash;<br />
      &ldquo;I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
      imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear
      of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones&mdash;therefore
      do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me&mdash;and,
      excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with
      me.&mdash;Yours, etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud,
      &ldquo;if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness&mdash;if she
      should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
      Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling
      colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is
      all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the
      carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her
      only alternative. She declared her resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you be so silly,&rdquo; cried her mother, &ldquo;as to think of such a thing,
      in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be very fit to see Jane&mdash;which is all I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;to send for the horses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when
      one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admire the activity of your benevolence,&rdquo; observed Mary, &ldquo;but every
      impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
      exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go as far as Meryton with you,&rdquo; said Catherine and Lydia.
      Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we make haste,&rdquo; said Lydia, as they walked along, &ldquo;perhaps we may see
      something of Captain Carter before he goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
      of the officers&rsquo; wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
      field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over
      puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view
      of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with
      the warmth of exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
      assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That
      she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty
      weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss
      Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for
      it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
      brother&rsquo;s manners there was something better than politeness; there was
      good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst
      nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
      brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the
      occasion&rsquo;s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking
      only of his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
      Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well
      enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
      immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
      alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for
      such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however,
      to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could
      attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary
      kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
      began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude
      they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his
      patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold,
      and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to
      return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed
      readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.
      Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies
      often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
      unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
      wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in
      parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of
      the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
      Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to
      Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of
      clothes.

      Chapter 8
    </h2>
    <p>
      At five o&rsquo;clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
      Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries which then poured
      in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much
      superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s, she could not make a very favourable
      answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this,
      repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it
      was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill
      themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference
      towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the
      enjoyment of all her former dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard
      with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions
      to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much
      an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very
      little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy,
      her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat,
      he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards;
      who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to
      say to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
      began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
      pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she
      had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and
      added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
      walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
      looked almost wild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
      nonsensical to come at all! Why must <i>she</i> be scampering about the
      country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in
      mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide
      it not doing its office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,&rdquo; said Bingley; &ldquo;but this was all
      lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when
      she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my
      notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley; &ldquo;and I
      am inclined to think that you would not wish to see <i>your sister</i>
      make such an exhibition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
      above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by
      it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a
      most country-town indifference to decorum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,&rdquo; said
      Bingley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,&rdquo; observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, &ldquo;that
      this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;they were brightened by the exercise.&rdquo; A short
      pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very
      sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with
      such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is
      no chance of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is capital,&rdquo; added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they had uncles enough to fill <i>all</i> Cheapside,&rdquo; cried Bingley,
      &ldquo;it would not make them one jot less agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
      consideration in the world,&rdquo; replied Darcy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
      hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
      their dear friend&rsquo;s vulgar relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on
      leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She
      was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late
      in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it
      seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs
      herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo,
      and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be
      playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she
      would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book.
      Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you prefer reading to cards?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;that is rather singular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Eliza Bennet,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley, &ldquo;despises cards. She is a great
      reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth; &ldquo;I am
      <i>not</i> a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,&rdquo; said Bingley; &ldquo;and I
      hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table
      where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others&mdash;all
      that his library afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit;
      but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I
      ever looked into.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am astonished,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley, &ldquo;that my father should have left so
      small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
      Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be good,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it has been the work of many
      generations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
      books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
      these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
      that noble place. Charles, when you build <i>your</i> house, I wish it may
      be half as delightful as Pemberley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
      neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
      finer county in England than Derbyshire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am talking of possibilities, Charles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley
      by purchase than by imitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little
      attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the
      card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest
      sister, to observe the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?&rdquo; said Miss Bingley; &ldquo;will she
      be as tall as I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet&rsquo;s height, or
      rather taller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so
      much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished for
      her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is amazing to me,&rdquo; said Bingley, &ldquo;how young ladies can have patience
      to be so very accomplished as they all are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net
      purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I
      never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
      informed that she was very accomplished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;has too
      much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
      otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far
      from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot
      boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my
      acquaintance, that are really accomplished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, I am sure,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; observed Elizabeth, &ldquo;you must comprehend a great deal in your idea
      of an accomplished woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! certainly,&rdquo; cried his faithful assistant, &ldquo;no one can be really
      esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
      with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
      dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all
      this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
      walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
      will be but half-deserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this she must possess,&rdquo; added Darcy, &ldquo;and to all this she must yet
      add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
      extensive reading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no longer surprised at your knowing <i>only</i> six accomplished
      women. I rather wonder now at your knowing <i>any</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> never saw such a woman. <i>I</i> never saw such capacity, and taste, and
      application, and elegance, as you describe united.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
      implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
      answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
      bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
      conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elizabeth Bennet,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,
      &ldquo;is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
      other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
      succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
      &ldquo;there is a meanness in <i>all</i> the arts which ladies sometimes
      condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning
      is despicable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue
      the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
      that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for
      immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be
      of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent
      physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to
      comply with their brother&rsquo;s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones
      should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly
      better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they
      were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after
      supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by
      giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to
      the sick lady and her sister.

      Chapter 9
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister&rsquo;s room, and in the
      morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
      enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
      and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
      sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note
      sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own
      judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its
      contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two
      youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
      very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not
      alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
      restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
      would not listen, therefore, to her daughter&rsquo;s proposal of being carried
      home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
      it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
      Bingley&rsquo;s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
      attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that
      Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I have, sir,&rdquo; was her answer. &ldquo;She is a great deal too ill to be
      moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a
      little longer on your kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Removed!&rdquo; cried Bingley. &ldquo;It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
      sure, will not hear of her removal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend upon it, Madam,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
      &ldquo;that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains
      with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;if it was not for such good friends I do not know
      what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast
      deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the
      way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have
      ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to <i>her</i>.
      You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the
      gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to
      Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though
      you have but a short lease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever I do is done in a hurry,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;and therefore if I should
      resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At
      present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You begin to comprehend me, do you?&rdquo; cried he, turning towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes&mdash;I understand you perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
      through I am afraid is pitiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate
      character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lizzy,&rdquo; cried her mother, &ldquo;remember where you are, and do not run on in
      the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know before,&rdquo; continued Bingley immediately, &ldquo;that you were a
      studier of character. It must be an amusing study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but intricate characters are the <i>most</i> amusing. They have at
      least that advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;can in general supply but a few subjects for
      such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
      unvarying society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
      observed in them for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
      country neighbourhood. &ldquo;I assure you there is quite as much of <i>that</i>
      going on in the country as in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
      turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
      victory over him, continued her triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my
      part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
      pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I am in the country,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I never wish to leave it; and
      when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
      advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye&mdash;that is because you have the right disposition. But that
      gentleman,&rdquo; looking at Darcy, &ldquo;seemed to think the country was nothing at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, blushing for her
      mother. &ldquo;You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
      such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,
      which you must acknowledge to be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
      many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods
      larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
      countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards
      Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying
      something that might turn her mother&rsquo;s thoughts, now asked her if
      Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since <i>her</i> coming away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
      William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel
      and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. <i>That</i> is my
      idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
      important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Charlotte dine with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For
      my part, Mr. Bingley, <i>I</i> always keep servants that can do their own work;
      <i>my</i> daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to
      judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I
      assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that <i>I</i> think Charlotte
      so <i>very</i> plain&mdash;but then she is our particular friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems a very pleasant young woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has
      often said so, and envied me Jane&rsquo;s beauty. I do not like to boast of my
      own child, but to be sure, Jane&mdash;one does not often see anybody
      better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
      partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother
      Gardiner&rsquo;s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure
      he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did not.
      Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her,
      and very pretty they were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so ended his affection,&rdquo; said Elizabeth impatiently. &ldquo;There has been
      many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
      discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been used to consider poetry as the <i>food</i> of love,&rdquo; said
      Darcy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
      strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am
      convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
      tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
      speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
      Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane,
      with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
      unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
      civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part
      indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon
      afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her
      daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each
      other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest
      should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the
      country to give a ball at Netherfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and
      good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection
      had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits,
      and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the
      officers, to whom her uncle&rsquo;s good dinners, and her own easy manners
      recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal,
      therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly
      reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful
      thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack
      was delightful to their mother&rsquo;s ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your
      sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the
      ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia declared herself satisfied. &ldquo;Oh! yes&mdash;it would be much better
      to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
      would be at Meryton again. And when you have given <i>your</i> ball,&rdquo; she
      added, &ldquo;I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
      Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
      instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations&rsquo; behaviour to the
      remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
      could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of <i>her</i>, in spite
      of all Miss Bingley&rsquo;s witticisms on <i>fine eyes</i>.

      The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
      Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
      continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
      their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.
      Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the
      progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
      messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.
      Hurst was observing their game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
      attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
      commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness
      of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
      with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
      exactly in union with her opinion of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You write uncommonly fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year!
      Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already told her so once, by your desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens
      remarkably well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;but I always mend my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you contrive to write so even?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;
      and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
      little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
      Grantley&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
      present I have not room to do them justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
      always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to
      determine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
      ease, cannot write ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,&rdquo; cried her brother,
      &ldquo;because he does <i>not</i> write with ease. He studies too much for words
      of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My style of writing is very different from yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Miss Bingley, &ldquo;Charles writes in the most careless way
      imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them&mdash;by
      which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my
      correspondents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your humility, Mr. Bingley,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;must disarm reproof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is more deceitful,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;than the appearance of humility.
      It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect
      boast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which of the two do you call <i>my</i> little recent piece of
      modesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing,
      because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and
      carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least
      highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always
      prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the
      imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning
      that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in
      five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to
      yourself&mdash;and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance
      which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real
      advantage to yourself or anyone else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried Bingley, &ldquo;this is too much, to remember at night all the
      foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I
      believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.
      At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
      precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would
      be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on
      chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse,
      a friend were to say, &lsquo;Bingley, you had better stay till next week,&rsquo; you
      would probably do it, you would probably not go&mdash;and at another word,
      might stay a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have only proved by this,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, &ldquo;that Mr. Bingley did not
      do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more
      than he did himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am exceedingly gratified,&rdquo; said Bingley, &ldquo;by your converting what my
      friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
      afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
      intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a
      circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
      could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as
      atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but
      which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand
      according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the
      friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of
      his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in
      favour of its propriety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To yield readily&mdash;easily&mdash;to the <i>persuasion</i> of a friend
      is no merit with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
      friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one
      readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one
      into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
      supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
      circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
      thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
      where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
      very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with
      the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
      with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain
      to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the
      parties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; cried Bingley; &ldquo;let us hear all the particulars, not
      forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
      weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
      you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
      myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
      know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
      particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
      when he has nothing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
      rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
      resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
      brother for talking such nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see your design, Bingley,&rdquo; said his friend. &ldquo;You dislike an argument,
      and want to silence this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
      Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
      thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you ask,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy
      had much better finish his letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for
      an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the
      pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way
      which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,
      Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
      that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on
      her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
      admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
      he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,
      at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong
      and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other
      person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little
      to care for his approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
      lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth,
      said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
      opportunity of dancing a reel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
      surprise at her silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine
      what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; that you might
      have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in
      overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their
      premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you,
      that I do not want to dance a reel at all&mdash;and now despise me if you
      dare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do not dare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
      gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner
      which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never
      been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that
      were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety
      for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her
      desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
      their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
      next day, &ldquo;you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
      desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
      and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
      officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check
      that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your
      lady possesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed
      in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge.
      They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for
      your Elizabeth&rsquo;s picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter
      could do justice to those beautiful eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour
      and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know that you intended to walk,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley, in some
      confusion, lest they had been overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You used us abominably ill,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Hurst, &ldquo;running away without
      telling us that you were coming out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by
      herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness, and
      immediately said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
      avenue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
      laughingly answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to
      uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.
      Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
      being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as
      to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
    </p>

      Chapter 11
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and
      seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,
      where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of
      pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were
      during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers
      of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment
      with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their
      acquaintance with spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss
      Bingley&rsquo;s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something
      to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to
      Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a
      slight bow, and said he was &ldquo;very glad;&rdquo; but diffuseness and warmth
      remained for Bingley&rsquo;s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The
      first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer
      from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side
      of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door. He then sat
      down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the
      opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table&mdash;but
      in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish
      for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She
      assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole
      party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore
      nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.
      Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst,
      principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now
      and then in her brother&rsquo;s conversation with Miss Bennet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bingley&rsquo;s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s
      progress through <i>his</i> book, as in reading her own; and she was
      perpetually either making some enquiry, or looking at his page. She could
      not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
      question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
      amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
      second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, &ldquo;How pleasant it is
      to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment
      like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I
      have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent
      library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
      cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her
      brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
      Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
      the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some
      among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean Darcy,&rdquo; cried her brother, &ldquo;he may go to bed, if he chooses,
      before it begins&mdash;but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing;
      and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my
      cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like balls infinitely better,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;if they were
      carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
      tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
      more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
      the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
      near so much like a ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked
      about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at
      whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation
      of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to
      Elizabeth, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
      turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
      long in one attitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
      succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up.
      He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
      Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
      directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
      he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
      the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
      interfere. &ldquo;What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his
      meaning?&rdquo;&mdash;and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; was her answer; &ldquo;but depend upon it, he means to be severe
      on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
      anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two
      motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,&rdquo; said he, as soon
      as she allowed him to speak. &ldquo;You either choose this method of passing the
      evening because you are in each other&rsquo;s confidence, and have secret
      affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear
      to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely
      in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by
      the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! shocking!&rdquo; cried Miss Bingley. &ldquo;I never heard anything so abominable.
      How shall we punish him for such a speech?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. &ldquo;We
      can all plague and punish one another. Tease him&mdash;laugh at him.
      Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But upon my honour, I do <i>not</i>. I do assure you that my intimacy has
      not yet taught me <i>that</i>. Tease calmness of manner and presence of
      mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not
      expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.
      Mr. Darcy may hug himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;That is an uncommon
      advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great
      loss to <i>me</i> to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Bingley,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has given me more credit than can be. The wisest
      and the best of men&mdash;nay, the wisest and best of their actions&mdash;may
      be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth&mdash;&ldquo;there are such people, but I hope I
      am not one of <i>them</i>. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
      Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, <i>do</i> divert me, I
      own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are
      precisely what you are without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my
      life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding
      to ridicule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such as vanity and pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride&mdash;where there is a real
      superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,&rdquo; said Miss Bingley;
      &ldquo;and pray what is the result?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
      himself without disguise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
      but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
      for. It is, I believe, too little yielding&mdash;certainly too little for
      the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of
      others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings
      are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would
      perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>That</i> is a failing indeed!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;Implacable resentment
      <i>is</i> a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
      really cannot <i>laugh</i> at it. You are safe from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
      evil&mdash;a natural defect, which not even the best education can
      overcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>your</i> defect is to hate everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yours,&rdquo; he replied with a smile, &ldquo;is willfully to misunderstand
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do let us have a little music,&rdquo; cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
      conversation in which she had no share. &ldquo;Louisa, you will not mind my
      waking Mr. Hurst?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened;
      and Darcy, after a few moments&rsquo; recollection, was not sorry for it. He
      began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.

      Chapter 12
    </h2>
    <p>
      In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
      next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
      them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her
      daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would
      exactly finish Jane&rsquo;s week, could not bring herself to receive them with
      pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not
      to Elizabeth&rsquo;s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent
      them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday;
      and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister
      pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. Against
      staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved&mdash;nor did
      she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being
      considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to
      borrow Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled
      that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be
      mentioned, and the request made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said
      of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane;
      and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry
      that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one
      sister much exceeded her affection for the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
      soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
      safe for her&mdash;that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm
      where she felt herself to be right.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence&mdash;Elizabeth had been at
      Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked&mdash;and
      Miss Bingley was uncivil to <i>her</i>, and more teasing than usual to
      himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of
      admiration should <i>now</i> escape him, nothing that could elevate her
      with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea
      had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material
      weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely
      spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were
      at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most
      conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
      all, took place. Miss Bingley&rsquo;s civility to Elizabeth increased at last
      very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
      after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see
      her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly,
      she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole
      party in the liveliest of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
      wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
      trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their father,
      though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see
      them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening
      conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
      animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human
      nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of
      threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for
      them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said in the
      regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined
      lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually
      been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.

    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast
      the next morning, &ldquo;that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I
      have reason to expect an addition to our family party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
      unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in&mdash;and I hope <i>my</i>
      dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s eyes sparkled. &ldquo;A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
      Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.
      Bingley. But&mdash;good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to
      be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell&mdash;I must speak to Hill
      this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is <i>not</i> Mr. Bingley,&rdquo; said her husband; &ldquo;it is a person whom I
      never saw in the whole course of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
      eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I
      answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early
      attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may
      turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear,&rdquo; cried his wife, &ldquo;I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray
      do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the
      world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children;
      and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do
      something or other about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They
      had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.
      Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly
      against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five
      daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet, &ldquo;and nothing
      can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you
      will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his
      manner of expressing himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him
      to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends.
      Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head,
      as you will hear.&rdquo;

    <p class="letter">
      &ldquo;Dear Sir,&mdash;<br />
      &ldquo;The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father
      always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to
      lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I
      was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful
      to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had
      always pleased him to be at variance.&mdash;&lsquo;There, Mrs. Bennet.&rsquo;&mdash;My
      mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received
      ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by
      the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of
      Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the
      valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to
      demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever
      ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the
      Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote
      and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my
      influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures
      are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the
      entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not
      lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than
      concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg
      leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to
      make them every possible amends&mdash;but of this hereafter. If you should
      have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the
      satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by
      four o&rsquo;clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the
      Saturday se&rsquo;ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience,
      as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a
      Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of
      the day.&mdash;I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your
      lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,
    </p>
    <p class="right">
      &ldquo;WILLIAM COLLINS&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At four o&rsquo;clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. &ldquo;He seems to be a most
      conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will
      prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
      indulgent as to let him come to us again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he
      is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
      discourage him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though it is difficult,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;to guess in what way he can mean to
      make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
      credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady
      Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
      his parishioners whenever it were required.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be an oddity, I think,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I cannot make him out.&mdash;There
      is something very pompous in his style.&mdash;And what can he mean by
      apologising for being next in the entail?&mdash;We cannot suppose he would
      help it if he could.&mdash;Could he be a sensible man, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
      reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
      letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In point of composition,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;the letter does not seem defective.
      The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is
      well expressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
      degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
      come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received
      pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for their
      mother, Mr. Collins&rsquo;s letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she
      was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her
      husband and daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
      politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
      ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need
      of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,
      heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately,
      and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he
      complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he
      had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen
      short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all
      in due time disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the
      taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no
      compliments, answered most readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove
      so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must
      confess. Not that I mean to find fault with <i>you</i>, for such things I
      know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go
      when once they come to be entailed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could
      say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and
      precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to
      admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are
      better acquainted&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
      other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s admiration. The
      hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
      and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s heart,
      but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future
      property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to
      know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing.
      But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some
      asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her
      daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for having
      displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all
      offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.

      Chapter 14
    </h2>
    <p>
      During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
      were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
      guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine,
      by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
      Catherine de Bourgh&rsquo;s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
      comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
      better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
      to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
      he protested that &ldquo;he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
      person of rank&mdash;such affability and condescension, as he had himself
      experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
      approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of
      preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and
      had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
      quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people
      he knew, but <i>he</i> had never seen anything but affability in her. She
      had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not
      the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood
      nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his
      relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he
      could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in
      his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations
      he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself&mdash;some
      shelves in the closet up stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, &ldquo;and I
      dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in
      general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
      from Rosings Park, her ladyship&rsquo;s residence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive
      property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, &ldquo;then she is better off than
      many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
      that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
      handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks
      the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
      constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many
      accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am
      informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
      resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to
      drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
      court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and
      by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British
      court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the
      idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those
      little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have
      more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter
      seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of
      giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of
      little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention
      which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You judge very properly,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet, &ldquo;and it is happy for you that
      you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether
      these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are
      the result of previous study?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
      sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
      compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give
      them as unstudied an air as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as
      he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
      maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
      and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in
      his pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to
      take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad
      to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented,
      and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it
      to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon,
      protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia
      exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose
      Fordyce&rsquo;s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had,
      with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him
      with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard;
      and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself
      on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and
      to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
      Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of
      a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I
      confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as
      instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
      backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
      very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.
      Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia&rsquo;s interruption,
      and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book;
      but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no
      ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated
      himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.

      Chapter 15
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been
      but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life
      having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father;
      and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the
      necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The
      subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally
      great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the
      self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential
      feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had
      recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford
      was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his
      veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of
      himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made
      him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and
      humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
      marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a
      wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them
      as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This
      was his plan of amends&mdash;of atonement&mdash;for inheriting their
      father&rsquo;s estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility
      and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet&rsquo;s lovely face
      confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
      was due to seniority; and for the first evening <i>she</i> was his
      settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a
      quarter of an hour&rsquo;s <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Mrs. Bennet before
      breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading
      naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for
      it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and
      general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.
      &ldquo;As to her <i>younger</i> daughters, she could not take upon her to
      say&mdash;she could not positively answer&mdash;but she did not
      <i>know</i> of any prepossession; her <i>eldest</i> daughter, she must
      just mention&mdash;she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be
      very soon engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth&mdash;and it was
      soon done&mdash;done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth,
      equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
      two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the
      day before was now high in her good graces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lydia&rsquo;s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
      except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at
      the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and
      have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him
      after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one
      of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet,
      with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings
      discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure
      of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to
      meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used
      to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in
      inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins,
      being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely
      pleased to close his large book, and go.
    </p>
    <p>
      In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins,
      their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger
      ones was then no longer to be gained by <i>him</i>. Their eyes were immediately
      wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than
      a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could
      recall them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they
      had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with
      another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr.
      Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to enquire, and he
      bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger&rsquo;s air, all
      wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to
      find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting
      something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the
      pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot.
      Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce
      his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from
      town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.
      This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only
      regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in
      his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good
      figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his
      side by a happy readiness of conversation&mdash;a readiness at the same
      time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still
      standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses
      drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.
      On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly
      towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal
      spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on
      his way to Longbourn on purpose to enquire after her. Mr. Darcy
      corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his
      eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
      stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
      looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.
      Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a
      few moments, touched his hat&mdash;a salutation which Mr. Darcy just
      deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to
      imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
      passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr.
      Phillip&rsquo;s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia&rsquo;s
      pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs.
      Phillips&rsquo;s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
      invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from
      their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly
      expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
      carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she
      had not happened to see Mr. Jones&rsquo;s shop-boy in the street, who had told
      her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because
      the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr.
      Collins by Jane&rsquo;s introduction of him. She received him with her very best
      politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his
      intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not
      help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship
      to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was
      quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of
      one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and enquiries about
      the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they
      already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was
      to have a lieutenant&rsquo;s commission in the &mdash;&mdash;shire. She had been
      watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street,
      and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have
      continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a
      few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become
      &ldquo;stupid, disagreeable fellows.&rdquo; Some of them were to dine with the
      Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call
      on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from
      Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips
      protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
      tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
      delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
      Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with
      unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
      between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
      both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such
      behaviour than her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.
      Phillips&rsquo;s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady
      Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
      she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly
      included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly
      unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his
      connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in
      the whole course of his life.

      Chapter 16
    </h2>
    <p>
      As no objection was made to the young people&rsquo;s engagement with their aunt,
      and all Mr. Collins&rsquo;s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single
      evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed
      him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had
      the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr.
      Wickham had accepted their uncle&rsquo;s invitation, and was then in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
      Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
      struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
      might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
      at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification;
      but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was
      its proprietor&mdash;when she had listened to the description of only one
      of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone
      had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment,
      and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
      with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
      improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen
      joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener,
      whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who
      was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.
      To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to
      do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent
      imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared
      very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and
      when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither
      been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest
      degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the &mdash;&mdash;shire
      were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them
      were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in
      person, countenance, air, and walk, as <i>they</i> were superior to the
      broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them
      into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
      turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
      himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
      conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel
      that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered
      interesting by the skill of the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
      officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
      ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
      listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly
      supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had
      the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know little of the game at present,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I shall be glad to
      improve myself, for in my situation in life&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Phillips was very
      glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received
      at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed
      danger of Lydia&rsquo;s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined
      talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon
      grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and
      exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.
      Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at
      leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though
      what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told&mdash;the
      history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention
      that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr.
      Wickham began the subject himself. He enquired how far Netherfield was
      from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating
      manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a month,&rdquo; said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
      drop, added, &ldquo;He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Wickham; &ldquo;his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten
      thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of
      giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been
      connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
      seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
      yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much as I ever wish to be,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth very warmly. &ldquo;I have spent
      four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right to give <i>my</i> opinion,&rdquo; said Wickham, &ldquo;as to his
      being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known
      him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for <i>me</i>
      to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
      astonish&mdash;and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
      anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I say no more <i>here</i> than I might say in any house in
      the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
      Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find
      him more favourably spoken of by anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot pretend to be sorry,&rdquo; said Wickham, after a short interruption,
      &ldquo;that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but
      with <i>him</i> I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded
      by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing
      manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should take him, even on <i>my</i> slight acquaintance, to be an
      ill-tempered man.&rdquo; Wickham only shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, &ldquo;whether he is
      likely to be in this country much longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not at all know; but I <i>heard</i> nothing of his going away when I
      was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the &mdash;&mdash;shire
      will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no&mdash;it is not for <i>me</i> to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If
      <i>he</i> wishes to avoid seeing <i>me</i>, he must go. We are not on
      friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no
      reason for avoiding <i>him</i> but what I might proclaim before all the
      world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his
      being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of
      the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I
      can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the
      soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
      scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and
      everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
      memory of his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
      all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further enquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
      neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had
      yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible
      gallantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;which was my chief inducement to enter the &mdash;&mdash;shire. I knew it
      to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
      further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
      attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society,
      I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits
      will not bear solitude. I <i>must</i> have employment and society. A
      military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now
      made it eligible. The church <i>ought</i> to have been my profession&mdash;I
      was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
      possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were
      speaking of just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the
      best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to
      me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
      and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
      elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth; &ldquo;but how could <i>that</i> be? How could
      his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give
      me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention,
      but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it&mdash;or to treat it as a merely
      conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
      to it by extravagance, imprudence&mdash;in short anything or nothing.
      Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
      was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
      less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
      anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may
      have spoken my opinion <i>of</i> him, and <i>to</i> him, too freely. I can
      recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of
      men, and that he hates me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some time or other he <i>will</i> be&mdash;but it shall not be by <i>me</i>.
      Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose <i>him</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
      ever as he expressed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what,&rdquo; said she, after a pause, &ldquo;can have been his motive? What can
      have induced him to behave so cruelly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thorough, determined dislike of me&mdash;a dislike which I cannot but
      attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
      less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father&rsquo;s uncommon
      attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not
      a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood&mdash;the sort
      of preference which was often given me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this&mdash;though I have never
      liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be
      despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
      descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes&rsquo; reflection, however, she continued, &ldquo;I <i>do</i>
      remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his
      resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be
      dreadful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not trust myself on the subject,&rdquo; replied Wickham;
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> can hardly be just to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, &ldquo;To treat
      in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!&rdquo; She
      could have added, &ldquo;A young man, too, like <i>you</i>, whose very
      countenance may vouch for your being amiable&rdquo;&mdash;but she contented
      herself with, &ldquo;and one, too, who had probably been his companion from
      childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
      manner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part
      of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the
      same amusements, objects of the same parental care. <i>My</i> father began
      life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so
      much credit to&mdash;but he gave up everything to be of use to the late
      Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.
      He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential
      friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest
      obligations to my father&rsquo;s active superintendence, and when, immediately
      before my father&rsquo;s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of
      providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of
      gratitude to <i>him</i>, as of his affection to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;How abominable! I wonder that the very
      pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better
      motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest&mdash;for
      dishonesty I must call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> wonderful,&rdquo; replied Wickham, &ldquo;for almost all his actions may
      be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has
      connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are
      none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
      impulses even than pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money
      freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
      poor. Family pride, and <i>filial</i> pride&mdash;for he is very proud of
      what his father was&mdash;have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his
      family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of
      the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also <i>brotherly</i>
      pride, which, with <i>some</i> brotherly affection, makes him a very kind
      and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried
      up as the most attentive and best of brothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
      speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother&mdash;very,
      very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely
      fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she
      is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
      and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father&rsquo;s death, her home
      has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
      education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
      help reverting once more to the first, and saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,
      who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be
      in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know
      Mr. Bingley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
      Darcy is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want
      abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his
      while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very
      different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never
      deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere,
      rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable&mdash;allowing something for
      fortune and figure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
      the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
      Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual enquiries as to his success were
      made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
      but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
      her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance,
      that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would
      not make herself uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know very well, madam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that when persons sit down to a
      card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am
      not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are
      undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine
      de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little
      matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a
      few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was
      very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Catherine de Bourgh,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;has very lately given him a
      living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice,
      but he certainly has not known her long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were
      sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s
      connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
      believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
      Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
      affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
      self-destined for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Collins,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
      daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I
      suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
      patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe her to be both in a great degree,&rdquo; replied Wickham; &ldquo;I have not
      seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her,
      and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation
      of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives
      part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her
      authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
      chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of
      the first class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
      they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put
      an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
      Wickham&rsquo;s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs.
      Phillips&rsquo;s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody.
      Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.
      Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing
      but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but
      there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for
      neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly
      of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and
      Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips,
      protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist,
      enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he
      crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the
      carriage stopped at Longbourn House.

      Chapter 17
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham
      and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how
      to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s regard;
      and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man
      of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having
      endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings;
      and nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both,
      to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or
      mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have both,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
      other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
      misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
      conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
      without actual blame on either side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on
      behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
      business? Do clear <i>them</i> too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
      somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.
      My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places
      Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father&rsquo;s favourite in such a manner, one
      whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of
      common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be
      capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in
      him? Oh! no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s being imposed on, than that
      Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last
      night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not
      so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is difficult indeed&mdash;it is distressing. One does not know what to
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jane could think with certainty on only one point&mdash;that Mr.
      Bingley, if he <i>had been</i> imposed on, would have much to suffer when
      the affair became public.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
      conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had
      been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal
      invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for
      the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear
      friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked
      what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest
      of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as
      possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.
      They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which
      took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape
      from Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s civilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
      female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
      compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
      receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
      ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society
      of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth
      thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of
      seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s look and behaviour. The
      happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single
      event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth,
      meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the
      only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball.
      And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While I can have my mornings to myself,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it is enough&mdash;I
      think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
      Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
      consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
      everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not
      often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him
      whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s invitation, and if he did,
      whether he would think it proper to join in the evening&rsquo;s amusement; and
      she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever
      on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the
      Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that a ball of
      this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
      have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself,
      that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in
      the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting
      yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference
      which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to
      any disrespect for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
      engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins
      instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for
      it, however. Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a
      little longer, and Mr. Collins&rsquo;s proposal accepted with as good a grace as
      she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea
      it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that <i>she</i>
      was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of
      Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings,
      in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to
      conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and
      heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and
      though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her
      charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the
      probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to <i>her</i>.
      Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that
      a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might
      never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
      younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
      time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there
      was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.
      No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after&mdash;the very
      shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have
      found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
      improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a
      dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
      Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.

    <h2><a name="link2HCH0018" id="link2HCH0018"></a>
      Chapter 18
    </h2>
    <p>
      Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain
      for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of
      his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him
      had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not
      unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care,
      and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained
      unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in
      the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion
      of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s pleasure in the Bingleys&rsquo;
      invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the
      absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom
      Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to
      go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding,
      with a significant smile, &ldquo;I do not imagine his business would have called
      him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
      Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
      Wickham&rsquo;s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
      of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
      disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the
      polite enquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
      Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She
      was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
      with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
      speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of
      her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
      spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
      not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
      the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.
      The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were
      dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising
      instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it,
      gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a
      couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
      Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
      were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
      her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her
      so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing
      what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she
      was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to
      console her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you will find him very agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid! <i>That</i> would be the greatest misfortune of all! To
      find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such
      an evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
      hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a
      simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
      in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer,
      and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was
      arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in
      her neighbours&rsquo; looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood
      for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their
      silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not
      to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater
      punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight
      observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause
      of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:&mdash;&ldquo;It is <i>your</i>
      turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. <i>I</i> talked about the dance, and <i>you</i>
      ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number
      of couples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may
      observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But <i>now</i>
      we may be silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
      entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of <i>some</i>,
      conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of
      saying as little as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
      imagine that you are gratifying mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth archly; &ldquo;for I have always seen a great
      similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn
      disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that
      will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the
      <i>éclat</i> of a proverb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;How near it may be to <i>mine</i>, I cannot pretend to say. <i>You</i>
      think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not decide on my own performance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the
      dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to
      Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the
      temptation, added, &ldquo;When you met us there the other day, we had just been
      forming a new acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of <i>hauteur</i> overspread his
      features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
      for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
      constrained manner said, &ldquo;Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners
      as may ensure his <i>making</i> friends&mdash;whether he may be equally
      capable of <i>retaining</i> them, is less certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been so unlucky as to lose <i>your</i> friendship,&rdquo;
      replied Elizabeth with emphasis, &ldquo;and in a manner which he is
      likely to suffer from all his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that
      moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through
      the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he
      stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing
      and his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very superior
      dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first
      circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
      disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
      especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her
      sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow
      in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:&mdash;but let me not interrupt you, sir. You
      will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
      young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
      William&rsquo;s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
      eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
      Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he
      turned to his partner, and said, &ldquo;Sir William&rsquo;s interruption has made me
      forget what we were talking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
      interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We
      have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are
      to talk of next I cannot imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What think you of books?&rdquo; said he, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Books&mdash;oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the
      same feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
      no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
      something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>present</i> always occupies you in such scenes&mdash;does it?&rdquo;
       said he, with a look of doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, always,&rdquo; she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
      thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by
      her suddenly exclaiming, &ldquo;I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that
      you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
      unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its <i>being created?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said he, with a firm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to
      be secure of judging properly at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask to what these questions tend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely to the illustration of <i>your</i> character,&rdquo; said she,
      endeavouring to shake off her gravity. &ldquo;I am trying to make it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is your success?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;I do not get on at all. I hear such different
      accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can readily believe,&rdquo; answered he gravely, &ldquo;that reports may vary
      greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
      not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
      fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
      opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,&rdquo; he coldly replied.
      She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
      silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
      in Darcy&rsquo;s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,
      which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with
      an expression of civil disdain accosted her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your
      sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
      questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among
      his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.
      Darcy&rsquo;s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give
      implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s using him
      ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been
      remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a
      most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well
      that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear
      George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could
      not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was
      excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His
      coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I
      wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this
      discovery of your favourite&rsquo;s guilt; but really, considering his descent,
      one could not expect much better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,&rdquo; said
      Elizabeth angrily; &ldquo;for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than
      of being the son of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s steward, and of <i>that</i>, I can assure
      you, he informed me himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
      &ldquo;Excuse my interference&mdash;it was kindly meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insolent girl!&rdquo; said Elizabeth to herself. &ldquo;You are much mistaken if you
      expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in
      it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.&rdquo; She then
      sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make enquiries on the same
      subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a
      glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was
      satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read
      her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment
      against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of
      Jane&rsquo;s being in the fairest way for happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
      sister&rsquo;s, &ldquo;what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
      been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
      you may be sure of my pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jane, &ldquo;I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
      satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his
      history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally
      offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity,
      and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has
      deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am
      sorry to say by his account as well as his sister&rsquo;s, Mr. Wickham is by no
      means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and
      has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s regard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied.
      But what does he say of the living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them
      from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him <i>conditionally</i>
      only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s sincerity,&rdquo; said Elizabeth warmly;
      &ldquo;but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
      Bingley&rsquo;s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since
      he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the
      rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both
      gentlemen as I did before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
      which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
      delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.
      Bingley&rsquo;s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in
      it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to
      Miss Lucas; to whose enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner
      she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her
      with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most
      important discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found out,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by a singular accident, that there is now in
      the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
      gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the
      house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady
      Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have
      thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh
      in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time
      for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he
      will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the
      connection must plead my apology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I
      believe him to be Lady Catherine&rsquo;s <i>nephew</i>. It will be in my power
      to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se&rsquo;nnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that
      Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an
      impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not
      in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that
      if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to
      begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined
      air of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking,
      replied thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your
      excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding;
      but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the
      established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate
      the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical
      office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom&mdash;provided
      that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You
      must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this
      occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.
      Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other
      subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I
      consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on
      what is right than a young lady like yourself.&rdquo; And with a low bow he left
      her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly
      watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.
      Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not
      hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of
      his lips the words &ldquo;apology,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hunsford,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lady Catherine de Bourgh.&rdquo;
       It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing
      him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him
      time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins,
      however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s contempt
      seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at
      the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
      Collins then returned to Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no reason, I assure you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to be dissatisfied with my
      reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
      me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying
      that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s discernment as to be
      certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
      handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
      her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train
      of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her
      perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very
      house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could
      bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring
      even to like Bingley&rsquo;s two sisters. Her mother&rsquo;s thoughts she plainly saw
      were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest
      she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she
      considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of
      each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking
      to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but
      her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an
      animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while
      enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young
      man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first
      points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how
      fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire
      the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising
      thing for her younger daughters, as Jane&rsquo;s marrying so greatly must throw
      them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her
      time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of
      their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than
      she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of
      pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was
      less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period
      of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might
      soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing
      there was no chance of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother&rsquo;s
      words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper;
      for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of
      it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only
      scolded her for being nonsensical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure
      we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing <i>he</i>
      may not like to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you
      to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so
      doing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would
      talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and
      blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
      glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
      she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
      convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
      of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
      steady gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
      had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
      likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
      Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
      tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
      had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
      preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
      entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but
      in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting
      was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth&rsquo;s eyes were fixed
      on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through
      the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at
      their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the
      hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after
      the pause of half a minute began another. Mary&rsquo;s powers were by no means
      fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.
      Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but
      Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two
      sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at
      Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her
      father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.
      He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,
      &ldquo;That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.
      Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
      Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father&rsquo;s speech, was afraid
      her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I,&rdquo; said Mr. Collins, &ldquo;were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
      should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
      air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
      compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to
      assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music,
      for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a
      parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement
      for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his
      patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not
      be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his
      dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as
      possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have
      attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards
      those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty;
      nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of
      testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.&rdquo; And
      with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so
      loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared&mdash;many smiled; but
      no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife
      seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and
      observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever,
      good kind of young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose
      themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been
      impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success;
      and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the
      exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a
      sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That
      his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of
      ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine
      whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of
      the ladies, were more intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
      Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
      could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her power
      to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
      somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
      He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
      that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
      her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
      the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her
      greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
      good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins&rsquo;s conversation to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s further notice;
      though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
      disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
      probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a
      manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an
      hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
      heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
      sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and
      were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
      every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a
      languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long
      speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters
      on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness
      which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at
      all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and
      Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked
      only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs.
      Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more
      than the occasional exclamation of &ldquo;Lord, how tired I am!&rdquo; accompanied by
      a violent yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
      civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and
      addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he
      would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without
      the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,
      and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
      her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next
      day for a short time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the
      delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
      settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
      see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
      months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
      with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
      Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
      man and the match were quite good enough for <i>her</i>, the worth of each
      was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.

      Chapter 19
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
      declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his
      leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no
      feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
      moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
      observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding
      Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after
      breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
      when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course
      of this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
      Bennet answered instantly, &ldquo;Oh dear!&mdash;yes&mdash;certainly. I am sure
      Lizzy will be very happy&mdash;I am sure she can have no objection. Come,
      Kitty, I want you up stairs.&rdquo; And, gathering her work together, she was
      hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me.
      He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going
      away myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.&rdquo; And upon
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to
      escape, she added: &ldquo;Lizzy, I <i>insist</i> upon your staying and hearing
      Mr. Collins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction&mdash;and a moment&rsquo;s
      consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
      over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to
      conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
      distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as
      they were gone, Mr. Collins began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing
      you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have
      been less amiable in my eyes had there <i>not</i> been this little
      unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected
      mother&rsquo;s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of
      my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my
      attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I
      entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life.
      But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it
      would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying&mdash;and,
      moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a
      wife, as I certainly did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
      with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not
      use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
      every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of
      matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add
      very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly&mdash;which perhaps I ought to
      have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
      recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling
      patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
      too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I
      left Hunsford&mdash;between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson
      was arranging Miss de Bourgh&rsquo;s footstool, that she said, &lsquo;Mr. Collins, you
      must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a
      gentlewoman for <i>my</i> sake; and for your <i>own</i>, let her be an
      active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a
      small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon
      as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.&rsquo; Allow me, by the
      way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
      kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages
      in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can
      describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,
      especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will
      inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of
      matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards
      Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there
      are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to
      inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however,
      may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving
      to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be
      as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place&mdash;which,
      however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has
      been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me
      in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the
      most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am
      perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your
      father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that
      one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till
      after your mother&rsquo;s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On
      that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure
      yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too hasty, sir,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You forget that I have made no
      answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
      the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your
      proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not now to learn,&rdquo; replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
      hand, &ldquo;that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
      man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
      favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a
      third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
      said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, sir,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, &ldquo;your hope is a rather extraordinary
      one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young
      ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their
      happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly
      serious in my refusal. You could not make <i>me</i> happy, and I am
      convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so.
      Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would
      find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,&rdquo; said Mr. Collins
      very gravely&mdash;&ldquo;but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
      disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing
      her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty,
      economy, and other amiable qualification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give
      me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what
      I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do
      all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer,
      you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my
      family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls,
      without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as
      finally settled.&rdquo; And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the
      room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I
      shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me;
      though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it
      to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first
      application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my
      suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female
      character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Collins,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth with some warmth, &ldquo;you puzzle me
      exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of
      encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to
      convince you of its being one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
      refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
      believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is
      unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be
      any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with
      the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
      circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
      consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
      means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
      portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
      effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore
      conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose
      to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according
      to the usual practice of elegant females.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of
      elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be
      paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again
      for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is
      absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak
      plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague
      you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are uniformly charming!&rdquo; cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry;
      &ldquo;and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both
      your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
      reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he
      persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
      encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in
      such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be
      mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.

      Chapter 20
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
      successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to
      watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door
      and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the
      breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on
      the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and
      returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to
      relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he
      trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his
      cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful
      modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.
    </p>
    <p>
      This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad
      to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by
      protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could
      not help saying so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that Lizzy shall be
      brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very
      headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will <i>make</i>
      her know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,&rdquo; cried Mr. Collins; &ldquo;but if she is
      really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be
      a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for
      happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in
      rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting
      me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute
      much to my felicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you quite misunderstand me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. &ldquo;Lizzy is
      only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as
      good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
      we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
      husband, called out as she entered the library, &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are
      wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy
      marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not
      make haste he will change his mind and not have <i>her</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on
      her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her
      communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the pleasure of understanding you,&rdquo; said he, when she had
      finished her speech. &ldquo;Of what are you talking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
      and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
      marrying him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, child,&rdquo; cried her father as she appeared. &ldquo;I have sent for you
      on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an
      offer of marriage. Is it true?&rdquo; Elizabeth replied that it was. &ldquo;Very well&mdash;and
      this offer of marriage you have refused?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
      accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or I will never see her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
      be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again
      if you do <i>not</i> marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if
      you <i>do</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,
      but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
      affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to <i>insist</i>
      upon her marrying him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; replied her husband, &ldquo;I have two small favours to request.
      First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
      present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
      library to myself as soon as may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs.
      Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed
      and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her
      interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and
      Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful
      gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her
      determination never did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He
      thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could
      refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.
      His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
      deserving her mother&rsquo;s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the
      day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her,
      cried in a half whisper, &ldquo;I am glad you are come, for there is such fun
      here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has made an
      offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who
      came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
      breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
      the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her
      to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.
      &ldquo;Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,&rdquo; she added in a melancholy tone, &ldquo;for nobody
      is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels
      for my poor nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte&rsquo;s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, there she comes,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Bennet, &ldquo;looking as unconcerned as
      may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she
      can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy&mdash;if you take it into
      your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will
      never get a husband at all&mdash;and I am sure I do not know who is to
      maintain you when your father is dead. <i>I</i> shall not be able to keep you&mdash;and
      so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the
      library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will
      find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful
      children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.
      People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great
      inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always
      so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
      attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
      irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of
      them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with an
      air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the
      girls, &ldquo;Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues,
      and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
      Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
      detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose enquiries after
      herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
      curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not
      to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation:
      &ldquo;Oh! Mr. Collins!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear madam,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;let us be for ever silent on this point. Far
      be it from me,&rdquo; he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
      displeasure, &ldquo;to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to
      inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man
      who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust
      I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive
      happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often
      observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied
      begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I
      hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam,
      by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter&rsquo;s favour, without
      having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to
      interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be
      objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter&rsquo;s lips
      instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly
      meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an
      amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of
      all your family, and if my <i>manner</i> has been at all reprehensible, I
      here beg leave to apologise.&rdquo;

      Chapter 21
    </h2>
    <p>
      The discussion of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s offer was now nearly at an end, and
      Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
      attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother.
      As for the gentleman himself, <i>his</i> feelings were chiefly expressed,
      not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
      stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her,
      and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were
      transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in
      listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to
      her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s ill-humour or ill
      health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
      had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
      not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
      Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to enquire if Mr. Wickham
      were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
      He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
      aunt&rsquo;s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was
      well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that
      the necessity of his absence <i>had</i> been self-imposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr.
      Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many
      hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might
      arise unpleasant to more than myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
      discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed
      on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to
      Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His
      accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it
      offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of
      introducing him to her father and mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
      from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,
      hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady&rsquo;s fair, flowing hand; and
      Elizabeth saw her sister&rsquo;s countenance change as she read it, and saw her
      dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself
      soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual
      cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on
      the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner
      had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her
      to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking
      out the letter, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good
      deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their
      way to town&mdash;and without any intention of coming back again. You
      shall hear what she says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of
      their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and
      of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house.
      The next was in these words: &ldquo;I do not pretend to regret anything I shall
      leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we
      will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful
      intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of
      separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend
      on you for that.&rdquo; To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with
      all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their
      removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not
      to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr.
      Bingley&rsquo;s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was
      persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unlucky,&rdquo; said she, after a short pause, &ldquo;that you should not be
      able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
      hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
      forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
      intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
      satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
      Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
      took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are
      certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles
      gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined
      on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant
      hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there
      for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had
      any intention of making one of the crowd&mdash;but of that I despair. I
      sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties
      which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so
      numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall
      deprive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is evident by this,&rdquo; added Jane, &ldquo;that he comes back no more this
      winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he <i>should</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master.
      But you do not know <i>all</i>. I <i>will</i> read you the passage which
      particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, <i>we</i>
      are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana
      Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
      affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something
      still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being
      hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you
      my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without
      confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My
      brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now
      of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the
      connection as much as his own; and a sister&rsquo;s partiality is not misleading
      me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman&rsquo;s
      heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing
      to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an
      event which will secure the happiness of so many?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of <i>this</i> sentence, my dear Lizzy?&rdquo; said Jane as
      she finished it. &ldquo;Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare
      that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is
      perfectly convinced of her brother&rsquo;s indifference; and that if she
      suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
      put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most willingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
      in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to
      town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does
      not care about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
      together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is
      not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy
      for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is
      this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more
      anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there
      has been <i>one</i> intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving
      a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it
      would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest
      Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her
      brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less
      sensible of <i>your</i> merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday,
      or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in
      love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,&rdquo; replied Jane, &ldquo;your representation
      of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust.
      Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can
      hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
      will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.
      You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
      accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
      elsewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must decide for yourself,&rdquo; said Elizabeth; &ldquo;and if, upon mature
      deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
      more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
      all means to refuse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you talk so?&rdquo; said Jane, faintly smiling. &ldquo;You must know that
      though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
      not hesitate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider
      your situation with much compassion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.
      A thousand things may arise in six months!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
      contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline&rsquo;s
      interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
      wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so
      totally independent of everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the
      subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane&rsquo;s
      temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the
      diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would
      return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
      family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman&rsquo;s conduct; but
      even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she
      bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go
      away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting
      it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley
      would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion
      of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited
      only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.

      Chapter 22
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the
      chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
      Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. &ldquo;It keeps him in good
      humour,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I am more obliged to you than I can express.&rdquo;
       Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that
      it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very
      amiable, but Charlotte&rsquo;s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any
      conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any
      return of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such
      was Miss Lucas&rsquo;s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when
      they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he
      had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did
      injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to
      escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and
      hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to
      avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him
      depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not
      willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known
      likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte
      had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the
      adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering
      kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards
      the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But
      little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      In as short a time as Mr. Collins&rsquo;s long speeches would allow, everything
      was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered
      the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him
      the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the
      present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The
      stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship
      from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss
      Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of
      an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and
      it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins&rsquo;s present
      circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
      they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
      exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more
      interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
      Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
      opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
      Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
      should make their appearance at St. James&rsquo;s. The whole family, in short,
      were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of
      <i>coming out</i> a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
      done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte&rsquo;s
      dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had
      gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in
      general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor
      agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be
      imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly
      either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was
      the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and
      however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
      preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the
      age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the
      good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the
      surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued
      beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably
      would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her
      feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her
      the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he
      returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before
      any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully
      given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity
      excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on
      his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same
      time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his
      prosperous love.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
      family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
      for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said
      how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his
      engagements might allow him to visit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear madam,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;this invitation is particularly gratifying,
      because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very
      certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
      so speedy a return, immediately said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is there not danger of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s disapprobation here, my good
      sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending
      your patroness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Collins, &ldquo;I am particularly obliged to you for
      this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a
      step without her ladyship&rsquo;s concurrence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her
      displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
      again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
      and be satisfied that <i>we</i> shall take no offence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
      affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from
      me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard
      during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence
      may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the
      liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin
      Elizabeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
      surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to
      understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
      younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She
      rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
      solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means
      so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve
      himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable
      companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done
      away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference
      with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The possibility of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s fancying himself in love with her friend
      had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that
      Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she
      could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so
      great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not
      help crying out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte&mdash;impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
      story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
      reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
      her composure, and calmly replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible
      that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman&rsquo;s good opinion,
      because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for
      it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their
      relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all
      imaginable happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what you are feeling,&rdquo; replied Charlotte. &ldquo;You must be surprised,
      very much surprised&mdash;so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry
      you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be
      satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was.
      I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins&rsquo;s character,
      connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of
      happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the
      marriage state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth quietly answered &ldquo;Undoubtedly;&rdquo; and after an awkward pause, they
      returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer,
      and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a
      long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable
      a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s making two offers of marriage
      within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She
      had always felt that Charlotte&rsquo;s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like
      her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into
      action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly
      advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating
      picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her
      esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for
      that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.

      Chapter 23
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she
      had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir
      William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her
      engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much
      self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he
      unfolded the matter&mdash;to an audience not merely wondering, but
      incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,
      protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and
      often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know
      that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without
      anger such treatment; but Sir William&rsquo;s good breeding carried him through
      it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his
      information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most
      forbearing courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a
      situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning
      her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a
      stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of
      her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by
      Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be
      expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the
      convenient distance of Hunsford from London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir
      William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a
      rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of
      the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken
      in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and
      fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however,
      were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real
      cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously
      misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during
      the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease her.
      Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could
      see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could
      speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months
      were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as
      he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it
      gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been
      used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more
      foolish than his daughter!
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less
      of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor
      could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia
      were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman;
      and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at
      Meryton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
      Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called
      at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though
      Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to
      drive happiness away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
      mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real
      confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in
      Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose
      rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and
      for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been
      gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the
      days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of
      thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and
      written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth&rsquo;s abode in
      the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that
      head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his
      happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour,
      Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of
      enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind
      wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to
      return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily
      approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as
      possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his
      amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collins&rsquo;s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure
      to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of
      it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn
      instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly
      troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her health was
      so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such
      were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the
      greater distress of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s continued absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day
      passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report
      which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield
      the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which
      she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Elizabeth began to fear&mdash;not that Bingley was indifferent&mdash;but
      that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she
      was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane&rsquo;s happiness, and so
      dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
      frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and
      of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and
      the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the strength
      of his attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Jane, <i>her</i> anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
      painful than Elizabeth&rsquo;s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of
      concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was
      never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour
      seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience
      for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come
      back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane&rsquo;s steady
      mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his
      reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
      first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and
      luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a
      great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at
      Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make
      an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
      anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and
      wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss
      Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her
      with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she
      concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she
      spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking
      of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters
      out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly
      of all this to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Bennet,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it is very hard to think that Charlotte
      Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that <i>I</i> should be forced to
      make way for <i>her</i>, and live to see her take her place in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better
      things. Let us flatter ourselves that <i>I</i> may be the survivor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of
      making any answer, she went on as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
      not for the entail, I should not mind it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should not you mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not mind anything at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
      insensibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How
      anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one&rsquo;s own
      daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!
      Why should <i>he</i> have it more than anybody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave it to yourself to determine,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet.

    <h2><a name="link2HCH0024" id="link2HCH0024"></a>
      Chapter 24
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Bingley&rsquo;s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
      sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
      the winter, and concluded with her brother&rsquo;s regret at not having had time
      to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
      the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
      writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy&rsquo;s praise occupied the
      chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
      boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the
      accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.
      She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother&rsquo;s being an inmate of Mr.
      Darcy&rsquo;s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with
      regard to new furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
      heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for
      her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline&rsquo;s assertion of
      her brother&rsquo;s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was
      really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much
      as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without
      anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of
      proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends,
      and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their
      inclination. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he
      might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought
      best, but her sister&rsquo;s was involved in it, as she thought he must be
      sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be
      long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else;
      and yet whether Bingley&rsquo;s regard had really died away, or were suppressed
      by his friends&rsquo; interference; whether he had been aware of Jane&rsquo;s
      attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the
      case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the
      difference, her sister&rsquo;s situation remained the same, her peace equally
      wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
      Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s leaving them together, after a
      longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
      not help saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no
      idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I
      will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all
      be as we were before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You doubt me,&rdquo; cried Jane, slightly colouring; &ldquo;indeed, you have no
      reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
      acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and
      nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not <i>that</i> pain. A
      little time, therefore&mdash;I shall certainly try to get the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a stronger voice she soon added, &ldquo;I have this comfort immediately,
      that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
      has done no harm to anyone but myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jane!&rdquo; exclaimed Elizabeth, &ldquo;you are too good. Your sweetness and
      disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I
      feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the
      praise on her sister&rsquo;s warm affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;this is not fair. <i>You</i> wish to think all the
      world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. <i>I</i> only want to
      think <i>you</i> perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be
      afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege
      of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really
      love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world,
      the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of
      the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence
      that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with
      two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte&rsquo;s
      marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin
      your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of
      situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins&rsquo;s respectability, and
      Charlotte&rsquo;s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large
      family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to
      believe, for everybody&rsquo;s sake, that she may feel something like regard and
      esteem for our cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
      could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
      Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
      understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a
      conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I
      do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him
      cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it
      is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change
      the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself
      or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security
      for happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,&rdquo; replied Jane;
      &ldquo;and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together. But
      enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned <i>two</i>
      instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not
      to pain me by thinking <i>that person</i> to blame, and saying your
      opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves
      intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always
      so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity
      that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And men take care that they should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of
      there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s conduct to design,&rdquo;
       said Elizabeth; &ldquo;but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
      unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
      want of attention to other people&rsquo;s feelings, and want of resolution, will
      do the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you impute it to either of those?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I
      think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in conjunction with his friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only
      wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
      happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may
      wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
      connections, and pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,&rdquo; replied
      Jane; &ldquo;but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They
      have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
      her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
      they should have opposed their brother&rsquo;s. What sister would think herself
      at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If
      they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he
      were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make
      everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not
      distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken&mdash;or,
      at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel
      in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light,
      in the light in which it may be understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s
      name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more,
      and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it
      clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less
      perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not
      believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of
      a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but
      though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had
      the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet&rsquo;s best comfort was that
      Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. &ldquo;So, Lizzy,&rdquo; said he one day,
      &ldquo;your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to being
      married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is
      something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her
      companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long
      outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to
      disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your
      man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
      all expect Jane&rsquo;s good fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mr. Bennet, &ldquo;but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
      that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make
      the most of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
      which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
      family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added
      that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard,
      his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now
      openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to
      know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known
      anything of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
      extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of
      Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances,
      and urged the possibility of mistakes&mdash;but by everybody else Mr.
      Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.

      Chapter 25
    </h2>
    <p>
      After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.
      Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.
      The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by
      preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope,
      that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed
      that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations
      at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins
      health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of
      thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
      brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at
      Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
      superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
      ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
      trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred
      and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.
      Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and
      a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest
      and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had
      frequently been staying with her in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first part of Mrs. Gardiner&rsquo;s business on her arrival was to
      distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
      done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
      Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
      had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls
      had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not blame Jane,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley
      if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she
      might have been Mr. Collins&rsquo;s wife by this time, had it not been for her
      own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused
      him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter
      married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much
      entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They
      are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.
      It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family,
      and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.
      However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I
      am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
      the course of Jane and Elizabeth&rsquo;s correspondence with her, made her
      sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. &ldquo;It
      seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I am
      sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as
      you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a
      few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that
      these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An excellent consolation in its way,&rdquo; said Elizabeth,
      &ldquo;but it will not do for <i>us</i>. We do not suffer by accident. It
      does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a
      young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was
      violently in love with only a few days before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that expression of &lsquo;violently in love&rsquo; is so hackneyed, so doubtful,
      so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied
      to feelings which arise from a half-hour&rsquo;s acquaintance, as to a real,
      strong attachment. Pray, how <i>violent was</i> Mr. Bingley&rsquo;s love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
      inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they
      met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two
      or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him
      twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms?
      Is not general incivility the very essence of love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&mdash;of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.
      Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not
      get over it immediately. It had better have happened to <i>you</i>, Lizzy;
      you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she
      would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of
      service&mdash;and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
      of her sister&rsquo;s ready acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; added Mrs. Gardiner, &ldquo;that no consideration with regard to this
      young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all
      our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so
      little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he
      really comes to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And <i>that</i> is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
      friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a
      part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may
      perhaps have <i>heard</i> of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he
      would hardly think a month&rsquo;s ablution enough to cleanse him from its
      impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
      never stirs without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
      correspond with his sister? <i>She</i> will not be able to help calling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will drop the acquaintance entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
      point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley&rsquo;s being
      withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
      convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
      hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his
      affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends
      successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane&rsquo;s attractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bennet accepted her aunt&rsquo;s invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys
      were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by
      Caroline&rsquo;s not living in the same house with her brother, she might
      occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,
      the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.
      Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother
      and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the
      engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it&mdash;of
      which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions,
      Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth&rsquo;s warm commendation,
      narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to
      be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough
      to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the
      subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence
      of encouraging such an attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected
      with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before her
      marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of
      Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances
      in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of
      Darcy&rsquo;s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence
      of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
      character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
      of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute
      description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of
      praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him
      and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s
      treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman&rsquo;s reputed
      disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident
      at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly
      spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.

      Chapter 26
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gardiner&rsquo;s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
      the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly
      telling her what she thought, she thus went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
      are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.
      Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or
      endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would
      make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against <i>him</i>; he is a
      most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I
      should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your
      fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.
      Your father would depend on <i>your</i> resolution and good conduct, I am
      sure. You must not disappoint your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself,
      and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elizabeth, you are not serious now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr.
      Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the
      most agreeable man I ever saw&mdash;and if he becomes really attached to
      me&mdash;I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the
      imprudence of it. Oh! <i>that</i> abominable Mr. Darcy! My father&rsquo;s
      opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to
      forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my
      dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you
      unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young
      people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
      engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of
      my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
      would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
      to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
      object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I
      will do my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
      often. At least, you should not <i>remind</i> your mother of inviting
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I did the other day,&rdquo; said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: &ldquo;very
      true, it will be wise in me to refrain from <i>that</i>. But do not
      imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has
      been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother&rsquo;s ideas as to the
      necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
      honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you
      are satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for
      the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
      being given on such a point, without being resented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by
      the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his
      arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now
      fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it
      inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she &ldquo;<i>wished</i>
      they might be happy.&rdquo; Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday
      Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave,
      Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother&rsquo;s ungracious and reluctant good wishes,
      and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they
      went downstairs together, Charlotte said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>That</i> you certainly shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
      come to Hunsford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
      visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father and Maria are coming to me in March,&rdquo; added Charlotte, &ldquo;and I
      hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as
      welcome as either of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the
      church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject
      as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence
      was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally
      unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without
      feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined
      not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been,
      rather than what was. Charlotte&rsquo;s first letters were received with a good
      deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would
      speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy
      she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were
      read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point
      exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed
      surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not
      praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her
      taste, and Lady Catherine&rsquo;s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It
      was Mr. Collins&rsquo;s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and
      Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe
      arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be
      in her power to say something of the Bingleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
      generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
      hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
      her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
      lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;is going to-morrow into that part of the town,
      and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. &ldquo;I
      did not think Caroline in spirits,&rdquo; were her words, &ldquo;but she was very glad
      to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to
      London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I
      enquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged
      with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy
      was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as
      Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident
      only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister&rsquo;s being in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
      persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
      blind to Miss Bingley&rsquo;s inattention. After waiting at home every morning
      for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
      visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
      the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no
      longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
      prove what she felt.
    </p>
    <p class="letter">
      &ldquo;My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her
      better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been
      entirely deceived in Miss Bingley&rsquo;s regard for me. But, my dear sister,
      though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I
      still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was
      as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for
      wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to
      happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not
      return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive
      in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no
      pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before,
      said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so
      altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to
      continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming
      her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say
      that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because
      she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure
      that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself
      farther; and though <i>we</i> know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet
      if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
      deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on
      his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her
      having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we
      must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from
      something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of
      talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to
      Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging
      harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong
      appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every
      painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy&mdash;your
      affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me
      hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never
      returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any
      certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have
      such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them,
      with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.&mdash;Yours,
      etc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
      considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All
      expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even
      wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review
      of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to
      Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s sister,
      as by Wickham&rsquo;s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had
      thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning
      that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send
      as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent
      partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of
      some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could
      see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but
      slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that <i>she</i>
      would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden
      acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the
      young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth,
      less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte&rsquo;s, did not
      quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary,
      could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few
      struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and
      desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
      circumstances, she thus went on: &ldquo;I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I
      have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and
      elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him
      all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards <i>him</i>;
      they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate
      her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good
      sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been
      effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to
      all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say
      that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be
      purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to
      heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open
      to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something
      to live on as well as the plain.&rdquo;

      Chapter 27
    </h2>
    <p>
      With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
      diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
      sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
      Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
      going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan
      and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as
      well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
      Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was
      novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable
      sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome
      for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and,
      in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any
      delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled
      according to Charlotte&rsquo;s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William
      and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was
      added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and
      who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told
      her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
      his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
      Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
      first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of
      bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she
      was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of
      her&mdash;their opinion of everybody&mdash;would always coincide, there
      was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him
      with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,
      whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and
      pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think
      him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a
      good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
      that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
      delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she
      had known Sir William&rsquo;s too long. He could tell her nothing new of the
      wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn
      out, like his information.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as
      to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner&rsquo;s door,
      Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they
      entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking
      earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.
      On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for
      their cousin&rsquo;s appearance would not allow them to wait in the
      drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a
      twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The
      day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and
      the evening at one of the theatres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her
      sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her
      minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
      spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to
      hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
      particulars also of Miss Bingley&rsquo;s visit in Gracechurch Street, and
      repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
      herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham&rsquo;s desertion, and
      complimented her on bearing it so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my dear Elizabeth,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;what sort of girl is Miss King? I
      should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
      between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
      and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
      because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl
      with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
      what to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather&rsquo;s death
      made her mistress of this fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain <i>my</i>
      affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making
      love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so
      soon after this event.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
      decorums which other people may observe. If <i>she</i> does not object to
      it, why should <i>we</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Her</i> not objecting does not justify <i>him</i>. It only shows her
      being deficient in something herself&mdash;sense or feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, &ldquo;have it as you choose. <i>He</i> shall be
      mercenary, and <i>she</i> shall be foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Lizzy, that is what I do <i>not</i> choose. I should be sorry, you
      know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
      Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
      much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
      where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
      neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones
      worth knowing, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
      unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a
      tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have not determined how far it shall carry us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gardiner,
      &ldquo;but, perhaps, to the Lakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance
      of the invitation was most ready and grateful. &ldquo;Oh, my dear, dear aunt,&rdquo;
       she rapturously cried, &ldquo;what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh
      life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to
      rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when
      we <i>do</i> return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being
      able to give one accurate idea of anything. We <i>will</i> know where we
      have gone&mdash;we <i>will</i> recollect what we have seen. Lakes,
      mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations;
      nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin
      quarreling about its relative situation. Let <i>our</i> first effusions be
      less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.&rdquo;

      Chapter 28
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every object in the next day&rsquo;s journey was new and interesting to
      Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen
      her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the
      prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
      search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
      The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
      smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road,
      the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,
      everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared
      at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a
      short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole
      party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight
      of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest
      pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she
      found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her
      cousin&rsquo;s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was
      just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to
      hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then, with
      no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken
      into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them
      a second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and
      punctually repeated all his wife&rsquo;s offers of refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in
      fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect
      and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing
      to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though everything
      seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh
      of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could
      have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said
      anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly
      was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or
      twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did
      not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture
      in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their
      journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them
      to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to
      the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in this garden was
      one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command
      of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the
      exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading
      the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
      interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
      with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the
      fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the
      most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the
      country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect
      of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park
      nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building,
      well situated on rising ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;
      but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
      frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took
      her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to
      have the opportunity of showing it without her husband&rsquo;s help. It was
      rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up
      and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave
      Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was
      really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte&rsquo;s evident
      enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
      was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
      in, observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de
      Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be
      delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt
      not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service
      is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and
      my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your
      stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at
      Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her
      ladyship&rsquo;s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I <i>should</i> say, one
      of her ladyship&rsquo;s carriages, for she has several.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,&rdquo; added
      Charlotte, &ldquo;and a most attentive neighbour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman
      whom one cannot regard with too much deference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
      telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,
      Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
      Charlotte&rsquo;s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
      and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was
      all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass,
      the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of
      Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively
      imagination soon settled it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for
      a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion;
      and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a
      violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and met
      Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
      there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
      haste, and come down this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and
      down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of
      this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden
      gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is this all?&rdquo; cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;I expected at least that the pigs
      were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La! my dear,&rdquo; said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, &ldquo;it is not Lady
      Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other
      is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who
      would have thought that she could be so thin and small?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
      Why does she not come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
      when Miss de Bourgh comes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like her appearance,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. &ldquo;She
      looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make
      him a very proper wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
      with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth&rsquo;s high diversion, was
      stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before
      him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the
      others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls
      than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte
      explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at
      Rosings the next day.

    <p>
      Mr. Collins&rsquo;s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
      The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
      visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
      wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing
      it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s
      condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I should not have been at all surprised by her
      ladyship&rsquo;s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
      Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
      would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
      could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an
      invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your
      arrival!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the less surprised at what has happened,&rdquo; replied Sir William, &ldquo;from
      that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my
      situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such
      instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
      visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they
      were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so
      splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
      Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes
      herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of
      your clothes is superior to the rest&mdash;there is no occasion for
      anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being
      simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
      doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
      objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of
      her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who
      had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
      introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
      to his presentation at St. James&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
      across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
      Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
      raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
      slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house,
      and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir
      Lewis de Bourgh.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria&rsquo;s alarm was every moment
      increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that
      spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and
      the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness
      without trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous
      air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the
      servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her
      daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great
      condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it
      with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was
      performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
      which he would have thought necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of having been at St. James&rsquo;s, Sir William was so completely awed
      by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to
      make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his
      daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her
      chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal
      to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.
      Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features,
      which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was
      her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their
      inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever
      she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her
      self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth&rsquo;s mind;
      and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady
      Catherine to be exactly what he represented.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she
      soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
      daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria&rsquo;s astonishment at her
      being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any
      likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
      features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little,
      except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was
      nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she
      said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
      admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and
      Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking
      at in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and
      all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had
      likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her
      ladyship&rsquo;s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
      nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity;
      and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who
      was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner
      which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine
      seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious
      smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.
      The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak
      whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and
      Miss de Bourgh&mdash;the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady
      Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs.
      Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate,
      pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria
      thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but
      eat and admire.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done
      but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission
      till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so
      decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement
      controverted. She enquired into Charlotte&rsquo;s domestic concerns familiarly
      and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them
      all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as
      hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.
      Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady&rsquo;s attention,
      which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the
      intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of
      questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose
      connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a
      very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how
      many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself,
      whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome,
      where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had
      been her mother&rsquo;s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
      questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake,&rdquo;
       turning to Charlotte, &ldquo;I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion
      for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary
      in Sir Lewis de Bourgh&rsquo;s family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! then&mdash;some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
      instrument is a capital one, probably superior to&mdash;&mdash;You shall
      try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs
      all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you
      draw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, none of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
      should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your governess left you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never had any governess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
      without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have
      been quite a slave to your education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
      the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must
      have been neglected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished
      to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and
      had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle,
      certainly might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
      known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
      one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
      and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
      wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
      way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
      of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it
      was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was
      merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted
      with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf&rsquo;s calling yesterday
      to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. &lsquo;Lady Catherine,&rsquo; said she,
      &lsquo;you have given me a treasure.&rsquo; Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss
      Bennet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The
      younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters
      must be very young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps <i>she</i> is full young to be
      much in company. But really, ma&rsquo;am, I think it would be very hard upon
      younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
      amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
      marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
      as the first. And to be kept back on <i>such</i> a motive! I think it
      would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said her ladyship, &ldquo;you give your opinion very decidedly
      for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With three younger sisters grown up,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, smiling, &ldquo;your
      ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
      and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
      dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal
      your age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not one-and-twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were
      placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to
      quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls
      had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their
      table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did
      not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of
      Miss de Bourgh&rsquo;s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too
      little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine
      was generally speaking&mdash;stating the mistakes of the three others, or
      relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to
      everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and
      apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much.
      He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the
      tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
      gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round
      the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have
      on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival
      of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins&rsquo;s side
      and as many bows on Sir William&rsquo;s they departed. As soon as they had
      driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her
      opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte&rsquo;s sake,
      she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though
      costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he
      was very soon obliged to take her ladyship&rsquo;s praise into his own hands.

      Chapter 30
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough
      to convince him of his daughter&rsquo;s being most comfortably settled, and of
      her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met
      with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to
      driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went
      away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth
      was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the
      alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now
      passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and
      looking out of the window in his own book-room, which fronted the road.
      The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first
      rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for
      common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect;
      but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did,
      for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own
      apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte
      credit for the arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were
      indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along,
      and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he
      never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every
      day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes&rsquo;
      conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not
      many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till
      Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be
      disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now
      and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing
      escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.
      She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised
      them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the
      furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted
      any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that
      Mrs. Collins&rsquo;s joints of meat were too large for her family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the
      commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate
      in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
      Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
      quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
      village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
      them into harmony and plenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
      and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one
      card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of
      the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the
      neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins&rsquo;s reach. This, however,
      was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
      comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with
      Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
      often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she
      frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along
      the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice
      sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she
      felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
      Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition
      to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.
      Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected
      there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her
      acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one
      comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be
      amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley&rsquo;s designs on him were, by his
      behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady
      Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke
      of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find
      that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking
      the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in
      order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as
      the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
      intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
      respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
      Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
      his uncle Lord &mdash;&mdash;, and, to the great surprise of all the
      party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte
      had seen them from her husband&rsquo;s room, crossing the road, and immediately
      running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect,
      adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never
      have come so soon to wait upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
      before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
      afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who
      led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address
      most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to
      look in Hertfordshire&mdash;paid his compliments, with his usual reserve,
      to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met
      her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him
      without saying a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness
      and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin,
      after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to
      Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length,
      however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after
      the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a
      moment&rsquo;s pause, added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
      happened to see her there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
      whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
      Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he
      answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
      subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
      away.

    <p>
      Colonel Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and
      the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of
      their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
      received any invitation thither&mdash;for while there were visitors in the
      house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost
      a week after the gentlemen&rsquo;s arrival, that they were honoured by such an
      attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there
      in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of Lady
      Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage
      more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
      the party in Lady Catherine&rsquo;s drawing-room. Her ladyship received them
      civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable
      as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed
      by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to
      any other person in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome
      relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins&rsquo;s pretty friend had moreover
      caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so
      agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of
      new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well
      entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit
      and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as
      of Mr. Darcy. <i>His</i> eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards
      them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while,
      shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple
      to call out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of?
      What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are speaking of music, madam,&rdquo; said he, when no longer able to avoid a
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must
      have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are
      few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music
      than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should
      have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed
      her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.
      How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister&rsquo;s proficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,&rdquo; said Lady Catherine;
      &ldquo;and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does
      not practice a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, madam,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that she does not need such advice.
      She practises very constantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to
      her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell
      young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
      constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will
      never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins
      has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come
      to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson&rsquo;s room.
      She would be in nobody&rsquo;s way, you know, in that part of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt&rsquo;s ill-breeding, and made no
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
      promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He
      drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
      talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
      her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
      stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer&rsquo;s
      countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient
      pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
      me? I will not be alarmed though your sister <i>does</i> play so well.
      There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
      the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not say you are mistaken,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;because you could not
      really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had
      the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great
      enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your
      own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel
      Fitzwilliam, &ldquo;Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and
      teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in
      meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of
      the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.
      Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you
      knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire&mdash;and, give me leave to say,
      very impolitic too&mdash;for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
      things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not afraid of you,&rdquo; said he, smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,&rdquo; cried Colonel
      Fitzwilliam. &ldquo;I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall hear then&mdash;but prepare yourself for something very
      dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must
      know, was at a ball&mdash;and at this ball, what do you think he did? He
      danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain
      knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.
      Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
      beyond my own party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel
      Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;I should have judged better, had I sought an
      introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?&rdquo; said Elizabeth, still
      addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. &ldquo;Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
      education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
      himself to strangers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can answer your question,&rdquo; said Fitzwilliam, &ldquo;without applying to him.
      It is because he will not give himself the trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,&rdquo; said Darcy,
      &ldquo;of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch
      their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I
      often see done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fingers,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;do not move over this instrument in the
      masterly manner which I see so many women&rsquo;s do. They have not the same
      force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have
      always supposed it to be my own fault&mdash;because I will not take the
      trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe <i>my</i> fingers
      as capable as any other woman&rsquo;s of superior execution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Darcy smiled and said, &ldquo;You are perfectly right. You have employed your
      time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
      think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what
      they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady
      Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to
      Darcy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could
      have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of
      fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne&rsquo;s. Anne would have been a
      delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin&rsquo;s
      praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any
      symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she
      derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as
      likely to marry <i>her</i>, had she been his relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth&rsquo;s performance, mixing
      with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
      them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the
      gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship&rsquo;s carriage was
      ready to take them all home.

      Chapter 32
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane
      while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when
      she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.
      As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady
      Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished
      letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door
      opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only,
      entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
      intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
      to be within.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed
      in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary,
      therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting <i>when</i>
      she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what
      he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
      It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all
      after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before.
      He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly so, I thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short
      pause added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
      returning to Netherfield again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very
      little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and is at a
      time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
      neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might
      possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not
      take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his
      own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not be surprised,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;if he were to give it up as soon
      as any eligible purchase offers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend;
      and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble
      of finding a subject to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the hint, and soon began with, &ldquo;This seems a very comfortable
      house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins
      first came to Hunsford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she did&mdash;and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
      kindness on a more grateful object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
      the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him
      happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding&mdash;though I
      am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest
      thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
      prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance
      of her own family and friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day&rsquo;s
      journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should never have considered the distance as one of the <i>advantages</i>
      of the match,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;I should never have said Mrs. Collins was
      settled <i>near</i> her family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
      the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she
      understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
      Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.
      The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying
      circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling
      unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case <i>here</i>.
      Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will
      allow of frequent journeys&mdash;and I am persuaded my friend would not
      call herself <i>near</i> her family under less than <i>half</i> the
      present distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, &ldquo;<i>You</i>
      cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. <i>You</i>
      cannot have been always at Longbourn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
      feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and
      glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you pleased with Kent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
      calm and concise&mdash;and soon put an end to by the entrance of
      Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The
      <i>tête-à-tête</i> surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which
      had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few
      minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be the meaning of this?&rdquo; said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.
      &ldquo;My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have
      called on us in this familiar way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even
      to Charlotte&rsquo;s wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they
      could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of
      finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.
      All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books,
      and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in
      the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or
      of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from
      this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various
      times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now
      and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel
      Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion
      which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by
      her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident
      admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in
      comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel
      Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to
      understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten
      minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
      seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice&mdash;a sacrifice to
      propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated.
      Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s
      occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally
      different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as
      she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the
      object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to
      find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever
      he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her
      friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It
      was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were
      much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being
      partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins
      did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising
      expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it
      admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend&rsquo;s dislike would vanish, if
      she could suppose him to be in her power.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
      Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he
      certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
      to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
      in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.

      Chapter 33
    </h2>
    <p>
      More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly
      meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should
      bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever
      happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite
      haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!
      Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a
      voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal
      enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it
      necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor
      did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it
      struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some
      odd unconnected questions&mdash;about her pleasure in being at Hunsford,
      her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins&rsquo;s
      happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly
      understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into
      Kent again she would be staying <i>there</i> too. His words seemed to
      imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed,
      if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that
      quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find
      herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane&rsquo;s last letter, and
      dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in
      spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on
      looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the
      letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know before that you ever walked this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been making the tour of the park,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;as I generally do
      every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you
      going much farther?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I should have turned in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal.
      He arranges the business just as he pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
      pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems
      more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He likes to have his own way very well,&rdquo; replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
      &ldquo;But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than
      many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
      feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
      dependence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either.
      Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence?
      When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you
      chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are home questions&mdash;and perhaps I cannot say that I have
      experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
      weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where
      they like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my
      rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this,&rdquo; thought Elizabeth, &ldquo;meant for me?&rdquo; and she coloured at the
      idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, &ldquo;And pray, what is
      the usual price of an earl&rsquo;s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very
      sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a
      silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she
      soon afterwards said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
      having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
      lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well
      for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
      likes with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Colonel Fitzwilliam, &ldquo;that is an advantage which he must divide
      with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your
      charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a
      little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may
      like to have her own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in
      which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give
      them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got
      pretty near the truth. She directly replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say
      she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very
      great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss
      Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man&mdash;he
      is a great friend of Darcy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; said Elizabeth drily; &ldquo;Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
      Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy <i>does</i> take care of him in
      those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in
      our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
      him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
      Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,
      because if it were to get round to the lady&rsquo;s family, it would be an
      unpleasant thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend upon my not mentioning it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.
      What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having
      lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent
      marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I
      only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man
      to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been
      together the whole of last summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
      lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what arts did he use to separate them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not talk to me of his own arts,&rdquo; said Fitzwilliam, smiling. &ldquo;He
      only told me what I have now told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
      indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
      was so thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinking of what you have been telling me,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Your cousin&rsquo;s
      conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
      friend&rsquo;s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to
      determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. But,&rdquo; she
      continued, recollecting herself, &ldquo;as we know none of the particulars, it
      is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much
      affection in the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not an unnatural surmise,&rdquo; said Fitzwilliam, &ldquo;but it is a
      lessening of the honour of my cousin&rsquo;s triumph very sadly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr.
      Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and therefore,
      abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until
      they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as
      their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that
      she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be
      meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the
      world <i>two</i> men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless
      influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate
      Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to
      Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own
      vanity, however, did not mislead him, <i>he</i> was the cause, his pride
      and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still
      continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for
      the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say
      how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were some very strong objections against the lady,&rdquo; were Colonel
      Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s words; and those strong objections probably were, her having
      one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Jane herself,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;there could be no possibility of
      objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!&mdash;her understanding
      excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could
      anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities,
      has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which
      he will probably never reach.&rdquo; When she thought of her mother, her
      confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections
      <i>there</i> had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was
      convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his
      friend&rsquo;s connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite
      decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of
      pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
      headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to
      her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
      cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
      seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much as
      possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could
      not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s being rather displeased
      by her staying at home.

      Chapter 34
    </h2>
    <p>
      When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
      much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
      examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
      being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
      revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
      But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
      cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,
      proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
      disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
      noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention
      which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s shameful
      boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense
      of her sister&rsquo;s sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his
      visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next&mdash;and, a still
      greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane
      again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all
      that affection could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not think of Darcy&rsquo;s leaving Kent without remembering that his
      cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that
      he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to
      be unhappy about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
      door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
      being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the
      evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. But this
      idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected,
      when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an
      hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing
      his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with
      cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked
      about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a
      silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and
      thus began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
      repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
      doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement; and
      the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately
      followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the
      heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of
      tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority&mdash;of its being
      a degradation&mdash;of the family obstacles which had always opposed to
      inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the
      consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the
      compliment of such a man&rsquo;s affection, and though her intentions did not
      vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
      receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
      all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer
      him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
      representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all
      his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing
      his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As
      he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable
      answer. He <i>spoke</i> of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance
      expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate
      farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express
      a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they
      may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I
      could <i>feel</i> gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot&mdash;I
      have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it
      most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has
      been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short
      duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the
      acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it
      after this explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on
      her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.
      His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was
      visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of
      composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have
      attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth&rsquo;s feelings dreadful. At length,
      with a voice of forced calmness, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I
      might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little <i>endeavour</i>
      at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might as well enquire,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;why with so evident a desire of
      offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against
      your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not
      this some excuse for incivility, if I <i>was</i> uncivil? But I have other
      provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you&mdash;had
      they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that
      any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means
      of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
      was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
      excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted <i>there</i>. You dare
      not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only
      means of dividing them from each other&mdash;of exposing one to the
      censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its
      derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the
      acutest kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with
      an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even
      looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you deny that you have done it?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      With assumed tranquillity he then replied: &ldquo;I have no wish of denying that
      I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or
      that I rejoice in my success. Towards <i>him</i> I have been kinder than
      towards myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but
      its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not merely this affair,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;on which my dislike is
      founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided.
      Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months
      ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what
      imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what
      misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take an eager interest in that gentleman&rsquo;s concerns,&rdquo; said Darcy, in
      a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
      interest in him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His misfortunes!&rdquo; repeated Darcy contemptuously; &ldquo;yes, his misfortunes
      have been great indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of your infliction,&rdquo; cried Elizabeth with energy. &ldquo;You have reduced
      him to his present state of poverty&mdash;comparative poverty. You have
      withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him.
      You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which
      was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you
      can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
      &ldquo;is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I
      thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
      calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,&rdquo; added he, stopping in his
      walk, and turning towards her, &ldquo;these offenses might have been overlooked,
      had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that
      had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations
      might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my
      struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by
      unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by
      everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed
      of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me
      to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?&mdash;to congratulate
      myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly
      beneath my own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
      the utmost to speak with composure when she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
      declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern
      which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
      gentlemanlike manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
      would have tempted me to accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
      expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the very beginning&mdash;from the first moment, I may almost say&mdash;of
      my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest
      belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
      feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation
      on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had
      not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the
      world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings,
      and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for
      having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your
      health and happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the
      next moment open the front door and quit the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to
      support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
      half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was
      increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of
      marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for so
      many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the
      objections which had made him prevent his friend&rsquo;s marrying her sister,
      and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case&mdash;was
      almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so
      strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride&mdash;his
      shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane&mdash;his
      unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it,
      and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his
      cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity
      which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. She
      continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine&rsquo;s
      carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte&rsquo;s
      observation, and hurried her away to her room.

      Chapter 35
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
      which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
      surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything
      else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after
      breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
      directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s
      sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she
      turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The park
      paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the
      gates into the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
      tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look
      into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a
      great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure
      of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she
      caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the
      park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was
      directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to
      see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had
      turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved
      it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time
      reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took,
      said, with a look of haughty composure, &ldquo;I have been walking in the grove
      some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading
      that letter?&rdquo; And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the
      plantation, and was soon out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
      Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,
      perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite
      through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise full.
      Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from
      Rosings, at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of
      its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
      offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
      intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which,
      for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort
      which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should
      have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.
      You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your
      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand
      it of your justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
      magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
      that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
      from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
      claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
      prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly
      to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite
      of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on
      our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would
      be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose
      affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no
      comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last night so
      liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in
      the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their
      motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to
      myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be
      offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be
      obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
      others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman
      in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at
      Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
      attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I
      had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir
      William Lucas&rsquo;s accidental information, that Bingley&rsquo;s
      attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of
      their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time
      alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend&rsquo;s
      behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for
      Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I
      also watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as
      ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained
      convinced from the evening&rsquo;s scrutiny, that though she received his
      attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
      sentiment. If <i>you</i> have not been mistaken here, <i>I</i> must have
      been in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the
      latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to
      inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I
      shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister&rsquo;s
      countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer
      a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely
      to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is
      certain&mdash;but I will venture to say that my investigation and
      decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not
      believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on
      impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to
      the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to
      have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case;
      the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to
      me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still
      existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself
      endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. These
      causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your
      mother&rsquo;s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to
      that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed
      by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your
      father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for
      the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
      representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to
      have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,
      is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than
      it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say
      farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was
      confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led me
      before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
      connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you,
      I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters&rsquo; uneasiness
      had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon
      discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching
      their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We
      accordingly went&mdash;and there I readily engaged in the office of
      pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described,
      and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have
      staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would
      ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the
      assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister&rsquo;s indifference.
      He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not
      with equal regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger
      dependence on my judgement than on his own. To convince him, therefore,
      that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him
      against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given,
      was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done
      thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on
      which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to
      adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister&rsquo;s
      being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her
      brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill
      consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me
      enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this
      concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was
      done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other
      apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister&rsquo;s feelings, it was
      unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very
      naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured
      Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
      connection with my family. Of what he has <i>particularly</i> accused me I
      am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more
      than one witness of undoubted veracity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years
      the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the
      discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to
      him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore
      liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at
      Cambridge&mdash;most important assistance, as his own father, always poor
      from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a
      gentleman&rsquo;s education. My father was not only fond of this young man&rsquo;s
      society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest
      opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to
      provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first
      began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities&mdash;the
      want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his
      best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the
      same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in
      unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give
      you pain&mdash;to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the
      sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature
      shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character&mdash;it adds even
      another motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr.
      Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly
      recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that
      his profession might allow&mdash;and if he took orders, desired that a
      valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was
      also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive
      mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to
      inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I
      should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate
      pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
      benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be
      aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very
      insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be
      sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.
      I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was
      therefore soon settled&mdash;he resigned all claim to assistance in the
      church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive
      it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between
      us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to
      Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly
      lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free
      from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For
      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
      incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me
      again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me,
      and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had
      found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved
      on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question&mdash;of
      which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that
      I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my
      revered father&rsquo;s intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to
      comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. His
      resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances&mdash;and
      he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his
      reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance
      was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most
      painfully obtruded on my notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,
      and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
      to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your
      secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the
      guardianship of my mother&rsquo;s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About
      a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her
      in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to
      Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for
      there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.
      Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her
      connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose
      affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as
      a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent
      to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and
      after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge
      of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the
      intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of
      grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,
      acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.
      Regard for my sister&rsquo;s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure;
      but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.
      Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s chief object
      was unquestionably my sister&rsquo;s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds;
      but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a
      strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been
      concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you
      will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know
      not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you;
      but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you
      previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in
      your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I
      was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be
      revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more
      particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near
      relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the
      executors of my father&rsquo;s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every
      particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of <i>me</i> should
      make <i>my</i> assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same
      cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility
      of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting
      this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add,
      God bless you.

      Chapter 36
    </h2>
    <p>
      If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
      contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
      its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly
      she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her
      feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she
      first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and
      steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give,
      which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice
      against everything he might say, she began his account of what had
      happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her
      power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next
      sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one
      before her eyes. His belief of her sister&rsquo;s insensibility she instantly
      resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to
      the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He
      expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style
      was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham&mdash;when
      she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if
      true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore
      so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself&mdash;her feelings
      were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
      Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to
      discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, &ldquo;This must be false! This
      cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!&rdquo;&mdash;and when she had
      gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
      last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
      regard it, that she would never look in it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing,
      she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was
      unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again
      began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded
      herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of
      his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related
      himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before
      known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each
      recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference
      was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory,
      and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that
      there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few
      moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she
      read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately
      following of Wickham&rsquo;s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his
      receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again
      was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every
      circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality&mdash;deliberated on
      the probability of each statement&mdash;but with little success. On both
      sides it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more
      clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any
      contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s conduct in it less
      than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely
      blameless throughout the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
      Mr. Wickham&rsquo;s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
      bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his
      entrance into the &mdash;&mdash;shire Militia, in which he had engaged at
      the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
      had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing
      had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real
      character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of
      enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once
      in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of
      goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might
      rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance
      of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour
      to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many
      years&rsquo; continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see
      him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could
      remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the
      neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in
      the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more
      continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on
      Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between
      Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she
      was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
      himself&mdash;from whom she had previously received the information of his
      near concern in all his cousin&rsquo;s affairs, and whose character she had no
      reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
      him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
      at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
      have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
      cousin&rsquo;s corroboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
      between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips&rsquo;s.
      Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was <i>now</i>
      struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
      wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting
      himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
      with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of
      seeing Mr. Darcy&mdash;that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that <i>he</i>
      should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very
      next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had
      quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that
      after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no
      reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s character, though he had
      assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing
      the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His
      attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
      hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
      the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His
      behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
      either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
      his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
      incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
      and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but
      allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted
      his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his
      manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
      acquaintance&mdash;an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
      together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways&mdash;seen
      anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust&mdash;anything
      that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own
      connections he was esteemed and valued&mdash;that even Wickham had
      allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so
      affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable
      feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so
      gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed
      from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and
      such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could
      she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How despicably I have acted!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I, who have prided myself on my
      discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often
      disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in
      useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how
      just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more
      wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with
      the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the
      very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and
      ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this
      moment I never knew myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From herself to Jane&mdash;from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a
      line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s explanation
      <i>there</i> had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely
      different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that
      credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to
      give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
      sister&rsquo;s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte&rsquo;s
      opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his
      description of Jane. She felt that Jane&rsquo;s feelings, though fervent, were
      little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and
      manner not often united with great sensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
      mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of
      shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for
      denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having
      passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
      disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than
      on hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but
      it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
      self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that
      Jane&rsquo;s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations,
      and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such
      impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever
      known before.
    </p>
    <p>
      After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety
      of thought&mdash;re-considering events, determining probabilities, and
      reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so
      important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at
      length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing
      cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as
      must make her unfit for conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
      called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
      leave&mdash;but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at
      least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after
      her till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just <i>affect</i>
      concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was
      no longer an object; she could think only of her letter.

      Chapter 37
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having
      been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
      able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
      good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
      melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then
      hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return
      brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
      importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
      having them all to dine with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she
      chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future
      niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship&rsquo;s
      indignation would have been. &ldquo;What would she have said? how would she have
      behaved?&rdquo; were questions with which she amused herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. &ldquo;I assure
      you, I feel it exceedingly,&rdquo; said Lady Catherine; &ldquo;I believe no one feels
      the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to
      these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were
      excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied
      his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most
      acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings
      certainly increases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were
      kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
      spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
      she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you
      may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company,
      I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,&rdquo; replied
      Elizabeth, &ldquo;but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next
      Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you
      to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be
      no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you
      for another fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters
      are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another
      <i>month</i> complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as
      London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does
      not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of
      you&mdash;and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should
      not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original
      plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Catherine seemed resigned. &ldquo;Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant
      with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of
      two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You
      must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world
      to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly guarded and
      attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana
      went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two
      men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of
      Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a
      different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must
      send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me
      to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to <i>you</i> to let
      them go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle is to send a servant for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you have
      somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh!
      Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be
      attended to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
      and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which
      Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she
      might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for
      solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest
      relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might
      indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
      studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times
      widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was
      still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had
      condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his
      disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment
      excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not
      approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the
      slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour,
      there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy
      defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were
      hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would
      never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest
      daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was
      entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane
      in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while
      they were supported by their mother&rsquo;s indulgence, what chance could there
      be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely
      under Lydia&rsquo;s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and
      Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They
      were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they
      would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn,
      they would be going there forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxiety on Jane&rsquo;s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s
      explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,
      heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to
      have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could
      attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous
      then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect,
      so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been
      deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!
    </p>
    <p>
      When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham&rsquo;s
      character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
      seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
      almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her
      stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and
      her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their
      journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so
      urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria
      thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the
      morning, and pack her trunk afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a
      good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and
      Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand
      to both.

      Chapter 38
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
      minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying
      the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not, Miss Elizabeth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whether Mrs. Collins has yet
      expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
      certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.
      The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how
      little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of
      living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the
      world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself;
      but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we
      have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time
      unpleasantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had
      spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
      Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make <i>her</i>
      feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling
      solemnity replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
      disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having
      it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our
      connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home
      scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot
      have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine&rsquo;s
      family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which
      few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually
      we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the
      disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding
      in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at
      Rosings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
      obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
      and truth in a few short sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
      Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be
      able to do so. Lady Catherine&rsquo;s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have
      been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that
      your friend has drawn an unfortunate&mdash;but on this point it will be as
      well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I
      can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My
      dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is
      in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between
      us. We seem to have been designed for each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
      the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and
      rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the
      recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor
      Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had
      chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her
      visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and
      her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent
      concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
      placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
      parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr.
      Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with
      his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the
      kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments
      to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria
      followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly
      reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten
      to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you will of course wish to have your humble respects
      delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
      while you have been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the
      carriage drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; cried Maria, after a few minutes&rsquo; silence, &ldquo;it seems but
      a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great many indeed,&rdquo; said her companion with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
      How much I shall have to tell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth added privately, &ldquo;And how much I shall have to conceal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
      within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner&rsquo;s
      house, where they were to remain a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
      spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had
      reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn
      there would be leisure enough for observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
      Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s proposals. To know
      that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
      Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
      vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to
      openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in
      which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and
      her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
      repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further.

      Chapter 39
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
      together from Gracechurch Street for the town of &mdash;&mdash;, in
      Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s
      carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the
      coachman&rsquo;s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room
      up stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily
      employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard,
      and dressing a salad and cucumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out
      with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, &ldquo;Is not
      this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we mean to treat you all,&rdquo; added Lydia, &ldquo;but you must lend us the
      money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.&rdquo; Then, showing
      her purchases&mdash;&ldquo;Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think
      it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
      pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern,
      &ldquo;Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have
      bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will
      be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this
      summer, after the &mdash;&mdash;shire have left Meryton, and they are
      going in a fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they indeed!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
      take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and
      I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too
      of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; thought Elizabeth, &ldquo;<i>that</i> would be a delightful scheme
      indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a
      whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one
      poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I have got some news for you,&rdquo; said Lydia, as they sat down at table.
      &ldquo;What do you think? It is excellent news&mdash;capital news&mdash;and
      about a certain person we all like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need
      not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the
      waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
      things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he
      is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my
      news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There
      is no danger of Wickham&rsquo;s marrying Mary King. There&rsquo;s for you! She is gone
      down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mary King is safe!&rdquo; added Elizabeth; &ldquo;safe from a connection
      imprudent as to fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,&rdquo; said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure there is not on <i>his</i>. I will answer for it, he never
      cared three straws about her&mdash;who <i>could</i> about such a nasty little
      freckled thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness
      of <i>expression</i> herself, the coarseness of the <i>sentiment</i> was
      little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered;
      and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes,
      work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty&rsquo;s and Lydia&rsquo;s
      purchases, were seated in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nicely we are all crammed in,&rdquo; cried Lydia. &ldquo;I am glad I bought my
      bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let
      us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And
      in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you
      went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I
      was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you
      came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost
      three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married
      before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands,
      you can&rsquo;t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but <i>I</i>
      do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like
      to be married before any of you; and then I would <i>chaperon</i> you about to
      all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at
      Colonel Forster&rsquo;s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.
      Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs.
      Forster and me are <i>such</i> friends!) and so she asked the two
      Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by
      herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in
      woman&rsquo;s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a
      soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my
      aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot
      imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or
      three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord!
      how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And
      <i>that</i> made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out
      what was the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia,
      assisted by Kitty&rsquo;s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions
      all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but
      there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in
      undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say
      voluntarily to Elizabeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came
      to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that
      occupied them: Lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria, after the welfare and
      poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one
      hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some
      way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger
      Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person&rsquo;s, was
      enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Mary,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
      As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was
      nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had
      not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very
      handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon
      in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.
      And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have
      got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so
      merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might
      have heard us ten miles off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Mary very gravely replied, &ldquo;Far be it from me, my dear sister, to
      depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the
      generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for <i>me</i>&mdash;I
      should infinitely prefer a book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody
      for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
      Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed
      the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at
      home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was
      another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham
      again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to <i>her</i>
      of the regiment&rsquo;s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a
      fortnight they were to go&mdash;and once gone, she hoped there could be
      nothing more to plague her on his account.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton
      scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
      frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
      father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at
      the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
      disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.

      Chapter 40
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no
      longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular
      in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she
      related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy
      and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bennet&rsquo;s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
      partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
      natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
      sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
      little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
      unhappiness which her sister&rsquo;s refusal must have given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and certainly
      ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
      disappointment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth, &ldquo;I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
      other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You
      do not blame me, however, for refusing him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blame you! Oh, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you <i>will</i> know it, when I tell you what happened the very next
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
      as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
      who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so
      much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
      collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy&rsquo;s vindication, though grateful
      to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most
      earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to
      clear the one without involving the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will not do,&rdquo; said Elizabeth; &ldquo;you never will be able to make both
      of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
      with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
      enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
      about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy&rsquo;s;
      but you shall do as you choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know when I have been more shocked,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Wickham so very
      bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only
      consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
      knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of
      his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full
      of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing
      every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me
      saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light
      as a feather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!
      such an openness and gentleness in his manner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
      two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
      appearance of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the <i>appearance</i> of it as
      you used to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to
      him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one&rsquo;s genius, such an
      opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
      abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at
      a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the
      matter as you do now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And
      with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say
      that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had!
      Oh! how I wanted you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in
      speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they <i>do</i> appear wholly
      undeserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
      natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one
      point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or
      ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham&rsquo;s
      character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, &ldquo;Surely there can be no
      occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to
      make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative
      to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I
      endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will
      believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it
      would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place
      him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone;
      and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some
      time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their
      stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
      ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
      re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tumult of Elizabeth&rsquo;s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had
      got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
      and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to
      talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of
      which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half
      of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had
      been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could
      partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
      understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this
      last encumbrance of mystery. &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if that very
      improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell
      what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty
      of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
      state of her sister&rsquo;s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a
      very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in
      love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from
      her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments
      often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer
      him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to
      the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of
      those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their
      tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lizzy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bennet one day, &ldquo;what is your opinion <i>now</i>
      of this sad business of Jane&rsquo;s? For my part, I am determined never to
      speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day.
      But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is
      a very undeserving young man&mdash;and I do not suppose there&rsquo;s the least
      chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his
      coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of
      everybody, too, who is likely to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I
      shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I
      would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will
      die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she
      made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lizzy,&rdquo; continued her mother, soon afterwards, &ldquo;and so the
      Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will
      last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent
      manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving
      enough. There is nothing extravagant in <i>their</i> housekeeping, I dare
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. <i>They</i>
      will take care not to outrun their income. <i>They</i> will never be
      distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose,
      they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look
      upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a subject which they could not mention before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they
      often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an
      estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. <i>I</i> should be
      ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.&rdquo;

      Chapter 41
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the
      last of the regiment&rsquo;s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the
      neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The
      elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and
      pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they
      reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was
      extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?&rdquo; would they
      often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. &ldquo;How can you be smiling so,
      Lizzy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she
      had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I cried for two days together when Colonel
      Miller&rsquo;s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I shall break <i>mine</i>,&rdquo; said Lydia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one could but go to Brighton!&rdquo; observed Mrs. Bennet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&mdash;if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
      disagreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do <i>me</i> a great deal of good,&rdquo;
       added Kitty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
      Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of
      pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s
      objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
      interference in the views of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the gloom of Lydia&rsquo;s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
      received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the
      regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very
      young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and
      good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their
      <i>three</i> months&rsquo; acquaintance they had been intimate <i>two</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the
      delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be
      described. Wholly inattentive to her sister&rsquo;s feelings, Lydia flew about
      the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone&rsquo;s congratulations, and
      laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless
      Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as
      unreasonable as her accent was peevish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask <i>me</i> as well as Lydia,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;Though I am <i>not</i> her particular friend. I have just as
      much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years
      older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her
      resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
      exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
      considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for
      the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she
      could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She
      represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia&rsquo;s general behaviour, the
      little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as
      Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with
      such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than
      at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
      place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
      expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
      circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were aware,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, &ldquo;of the very great disadvantage to us
      all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia&rsquo;s unguarded and
      imprudent manner&mdash;nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure
      you would judge differently in the affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already arisen?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Bennet. &ldquo;What, has she frightened away some
      of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish
      youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not
      worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been
      kept aloof by Lydia&rsquo;s folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of
      particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
      importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild
      volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia&rsquo;s
      character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father,
      will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of
      teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her
      life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will
      be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever
      made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and
      meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a
      tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind,
      wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her
      rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is
      comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle,
      and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it
      possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are
      known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately
      taking her hand said in reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known you
      must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage
      for having a couple of&mdash;or I may say, three&mdash;very silly sisters.
      We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let
      her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of
      any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to
      anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt
      than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their
      notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own
      insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without
      authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
      continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in
      her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. She
      was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable
      evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
      father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
      united volubility. In Lydia&rsquo;s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
      every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of
      fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She
      saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at
      present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp&mdash;its tents
      stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
      and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw
      herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
      officers at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
      realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have
      been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.
      Lydia&rsquo;s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
      conviction of her husband&rsquo;s never intending to go there himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
      continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia&rsquo;s leaving
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
      frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well
      over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even learnt
      to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an
      affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour
      to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the
      inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had
      marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what
      had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding
      herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry;
      and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof
      contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his
      attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her
      preference secured at any time by their renewal.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the very last day of the regiment&rsquo;s remaining at Meryton, he dined,
      with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
      disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry
      as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned
      Colonel Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s and Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s having both spent three weeks at
      Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment&rsquo;s recollection
      and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and,
      after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she
      had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of
      indifference he soon afterwards added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long did you say he was at Rosings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you saw him frequently?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, almost every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His manners are very different from his cousin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. &ldquo;And
      pray, may I ask?&mdash;&rdquo; But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone,
      &ldquo;Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of
      civility to his ordinary style?&mdash;for I dare not hope,&rdquo; he continued
      in a lower and more serious tone, &ldquo;that he is improved in essentials.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Elizabeth. &ldquo;In essentials, I believe, he is very much what
      he ever was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice
      over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in her
      countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious
      attention, while she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his
      mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing
      him better, his disposition was better understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wickham&rsquo;s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look;
      for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he
      turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
      comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
      even the <i>appearance</i> of what is right. His pride, in that direction,
      may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only
      deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear
      that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding,
      is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
      judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I
      know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
      wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he
      has very much at heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
      slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on
      the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
      him. The rest of the evening passed with the <i>appearance</i>, on his
      side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
      Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
      mutual desire of never meeting again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from
      whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between
      her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one
      who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was
      diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and
      impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of
      enjoying herself as much as possible&mdash;advice which there was every
      reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous
      happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of
      her sisters were uttered without being heard.

      Chapter 42
    </h2>
    <p>
      Had Elizabeth&rsquo;s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not
      have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
      comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
      of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman
      whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their
      marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and
      confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness
      were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort
      for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of
      those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or
      their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes
      had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little
      otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his
      amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general
      wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are
      wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
      father&rsquo;s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but
      respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
      herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
      banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and
      decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children,
      was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the
      disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage,
      nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a
      direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have
      preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of
      enlarging the mind of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham&rsquo;s departure she found little
      other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
      abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and
      sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them
      threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in
      time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain
      were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might
      be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance
      by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon
      the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before,
      that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not,
      in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It
      was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement
      of actual felicity&mdash;to have some other point on which her wishes and
      hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation,
      console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.
      Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was
      her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the
      discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she
      have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been
      perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is fortunate,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;that I have something to wish for.
      Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
      But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
      sister&rsquo;s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
      pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never
      be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the
      defence of some little peculiar vexation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to
      her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
      always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that
      they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had
      attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her
      quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would
      have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent
      hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to the camp;
      and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be
      learnt&mdash;for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too
      full of lines under the words to be made public.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
      humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a
      happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back
      again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was
      restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June,
      Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears;
      an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the
      following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention
      an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious
      arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in
      Meryton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
      approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived
      from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed
      its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out
      till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a
      month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see
      so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and
      comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and
      substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan,
      were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that county there was
      enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.
      Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had
      formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a
      few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the
      celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
      the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was
      her business to be satisfied&mdash;and certainly her temper to be happy;
      and all was soon right again.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was
      impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
      owner. &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I may enter his county with impunity, and
      rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
      before her uncle and aunt&rsquo;s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and
      Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
      Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
      younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
      Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness
      of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way&mdash;teaching
      them, playing with them, and loving them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next
      morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment
      was certain&mdash;that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which
      comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences&mdash;cheerfulness
      to enhance every pleasure&mdash;and affection and intelligence, which
      might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor
      of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay;
      Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently
      known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the
      little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner&rsquo;s former residence, and
      where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent
      their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country;
      and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that
      Pemberley was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a
      mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before,
      Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. Mr.
      Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her
      approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
      much?&rdquo; said her aunt; &ldquo;a place, too, with which so many of your
      acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at Pemberley,
      and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She must own
      that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so many, she
      really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. &ldquo;If it were merely a fine house richly
      furnished,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I should not care about it myself; but the grounds
      are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth said no more&mdash;but her mind could not acquiesce. The
      possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
      occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and thought
      it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk.
      But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it
      could be the last resource, if her private enquiries to the absence of the
      family were unfavourably answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether
      Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its proprietor?
      and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer? A
      most welcome negative followed the last question&mdash;and her alarms now
      being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see
      the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and
      she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of
      indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. To
      Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.

      Chapter 43
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
      Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in
      at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
      entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a
      beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
      every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
      half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
      eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
      Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the
      road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building,
      standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;
      and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into
      greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither
      formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a
      place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so
      little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in
      their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of
      Pemberley might be something!
    </p>
    <p>
      They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
      while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
      meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
      mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall;
      and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder
      at her being where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine,
      and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her
      into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room,
      handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a
